2. (...) avoid doing anything which would risk unilateral measures being taken by the registrar
3. Search engine (...) Google also takes voluntary measures to remove access to material that it fears is contrary to European law – although it continues to allow US consumers access to that material.

6. You should also be aware that it also would be possible for your payment provider to disclose some of your financial information, even commercially sensitive information, to “judicial authorities or to the right holder (...).
7. It is important to be careful with linking to content on other websites or in choosing advertisements displayed (...)
8. Finally (...) advertising networks are increasingly being asked to take action by blocking payments to websites (...)❞
