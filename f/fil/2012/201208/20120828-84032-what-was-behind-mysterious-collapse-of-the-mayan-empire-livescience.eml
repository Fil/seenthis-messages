What Was Behind Mysterious Collapse of the Mayan Empire? | LiveScience
http://www.livescience.com/22581-mayan-empire-collapse-explained.html

❝Two new studies examine the reasons for the collapse of the Mayan culture, finding the Mayans themselves contributed to the downfall of the empire. 

Scientists have found that drought played a key role, but the Mayans appear to have exacerbated the problem by cutting down the jungle canopy to make way for cities and crops, according to researchers who used climate-model simulations to see how much deforestation aggravated the drought.❞
