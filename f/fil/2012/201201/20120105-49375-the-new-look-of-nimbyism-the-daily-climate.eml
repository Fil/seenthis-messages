The new look of NIMBYism — The Daily Climate
http://wwwp.dailyclimate.org/tdc-newsroom/2012/01/green-nimbyism

❝In Vermont, residents and environmentalists joined forces to protest the erection of 21 wind turbines in the state's sparsely populated northeast corner, on one of the largest pieces of privately held land in the state.
(...)
Even proponents acknowledge that some renewable projects could have a negative impact on air and water quality – and endangered or threatened species. Solar thermal installations, for example, can require significant quantities of water. And both wind and solar power require the construction of a transmission network to carry the juice to existing electrical grids.

"Do we say, 'Screw the environment for the sake of renewables' or do we say, 'Screw renewables for the sake of the environment'?" asked Greene.
(...)
Researchers say that, while public opinion polls show strong support for renewables as an antidote to energy production that contributes to climate change, the support wanes if the proposed project is nearby.❞
