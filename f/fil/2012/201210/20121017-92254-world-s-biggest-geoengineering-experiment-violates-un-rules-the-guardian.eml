World's biggest #geoengineering experiment 'violates' UN rules | the guardian
http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering

❝A controversial American businessman dumped around 100 tonnes of iron sulphate into the Pacific Ocean as part of a geoengineering scheme off the west coast of Canada in July, a Guardian investigation can reveal.

Lawyers, environmentalists and civil society groups are calling it a "blatant violation" of two international moratoria and the news is likely to spark outrage at a United Nations environmental summit taking place in India this week.❞
