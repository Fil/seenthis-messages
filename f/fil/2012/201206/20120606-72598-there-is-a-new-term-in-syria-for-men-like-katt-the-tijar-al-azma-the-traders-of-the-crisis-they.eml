❝There is a new term in Syria for men like Katt: the tijar al-azma, the traders of the crisis. They do business in three things: real estate, heating gas and diesel. And EU sanctions are actually helping these war profiteers. (...) Syria's poor have already been suffering as a result of the economic crash and price increases for a long time. But now even members of the middle class are having to dig into their savings and offer their houses to the super-rich -- people like Katt.
(...) The EU's sanctions were actually meant to specifically target people like Katt, in other words, businesspeople who are using their assets to support the regime. "One can buy politicians here with money," Katt says. In fact, Brussels even imposed sanctions on individual businesspeople who are financially backing the regime, such as the president's cousin Rami Makhlouf, who is believed to be a billionaire. In comparison, Katt is just a small fish who doesn't show up on Brussels' radar, thanks to the opaque nature of the ties between elements of the business and security worlds in Syria.❞
