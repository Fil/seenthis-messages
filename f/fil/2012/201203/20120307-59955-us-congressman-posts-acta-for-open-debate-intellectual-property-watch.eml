http://www.ip-watch.org/2012/03/07/us-congressman-posts-acta-for-open-debate/

❝A conservative United States congressional representative has posted the text of the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) to the internet and is calling for public comments out of the fear that the agreement will harm the open internet.

The website, keepthewebopen.com, created by California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, is already collecting a numerous comments, but with the agreement already signed by the US and others, it remains to be seen if it is too late for change.❞
