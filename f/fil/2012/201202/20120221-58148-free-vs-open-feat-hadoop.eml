Free vs. Open (feat. Hadoop)
http://bre.klaki.net/blog/2012/02/20/

distinction pas stupide :

❝
- The Free Software Community writes and shares software with an explicit intent to safeguard the rights and freedoms of its users by eliminating antifeatures and natural monopolies.
- The Open Source Community writes and shares software with an explicit intent to advance the state of the art of computing through open collaboration and publication.❞



❝Most of the time they are allies - but not always.

I feel the definitions above shed light on why:
- Free Software proponents often prefer licenses which restrict the freedom of the developer, in order to protect the end users from antifeatures and natural monopolies.
- Open Source folks are focused on technical excellence and getting a job done. Talking about ideals and rights becomes a distraction at best.
- Depending on the field, "advancing the state of the art" and "protecting users rights" may be fundamentally incompatible.
- Free Software folks benefit greatly from Open Source, but their ideals and restrictive licenses make them ill equipped to reciprocate.
