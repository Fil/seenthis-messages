Greater oversight but no sanctions for Italian AIDS contrarian : Nature
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/07/greater-oversight-but-no-sanctions-for-italian-aids-contrarian.html

❝An Italian university’s inquiry into the teaching activities of an academic who assisted on a course that denies the causal link between HIV and AIDS, and supervised students with dissertations on the same topic, has concluded with no disciplinary sanctions. But molecular biologist Marco Ruggiero’s teaching activities will be more closely supervised in the future (...)
The HIV Forum also said there were “many reasons” it too felt satisfied with the outcome, and the decisions were “precisely” what it had hoped to obtain with its letter. “Our target was not the career of someone, but the consistency of what is taught at the University of Florence with what thirty years of scientific research tells us about HIV,” it said. “[The result confirms] freedom of research and teaching must ‘move with the scientific method’.”❞
