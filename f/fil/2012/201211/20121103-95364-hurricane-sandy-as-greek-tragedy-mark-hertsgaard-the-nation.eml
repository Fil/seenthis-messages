Hurricane Sandy as Greek Tragedy, Mark Hertsgaard | The Nation
http://www.thenation.com/article/170918/hurricane-sandy-greek-tragedy

❝#Sandy is short for Cassandra, the Greek mythological figure who epitomizes tragedy. The gods gave Cassandra the gift of prophecy; depending on which version of the story one prefers, she could either see or smell the future. But with this gift also came a curse: Cassandra’s warnings about future disasters were fated to be ignored. (...)
And so it has been with America’s response to #climate_change.❞
