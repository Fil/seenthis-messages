Open-source cell phone network could cut costs to $2 per month | News | Engineering for Change

❝In the developing world, cell phones come before land lines. Why? Because installing cell towers is cheaper than running landlines. But even with lower costs, telecom companies avoid the poorest and hardest-to-reach areas. Where they do provide coverage, it's expensive, especially for the 3 billion people in the world who earn about $3 per day.
A small team of telecom industry veterans has solved both of those problems. The team developed OpenBTS, an open-source, software-based cellphone network. Not only does it cost one-tenth as much as traditional networks, but carriers could charge callers about $2 per month and still make a profit.❞
