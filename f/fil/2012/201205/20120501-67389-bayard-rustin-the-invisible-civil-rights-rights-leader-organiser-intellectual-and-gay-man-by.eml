Bayard Rustin: The invisible civil rights rights leader, organiser, intellectual and gay man - by Zackie Achmat « Writing Rights

❝A Quaker and therefore a pacifist, Rustin was one of the most important leaders of the Civil Rights movement in the United States. He was the chief organiser of the March on Washington for the civil rights of African-Americans where Martin Luther King jnr. gave his most famous “I have a Dream” speech. For decades, Rustin disappeared from history. Rustin’s gay identity and the homophobia of all progressive movements but specifically the Black community in the United States was at the core of his political invisibility.❞
