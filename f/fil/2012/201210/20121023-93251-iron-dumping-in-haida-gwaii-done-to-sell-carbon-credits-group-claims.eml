Iron dumping in Haida Gwaii done to sell carbon credits, group claims

❝The iron dumped off the coast of Haida Gwaii was primarily a bid to sell carbon credits — not a scientific experiment , according to a marine conservation society working on B.C.’s Pacific coast.

The Living Oceans Society obtained correspondence between the Old Massett village council, which is running the project, and the Northern Savings Credit Union, which lent the council $2.5 million to finance it. The documents were made available on the society’s website and show the lender was aware the ocean restoration project involved selling carbon credits.

“What is illegal, under international law, is dumping with the intent to obtain commercial gain,” said❞
