#géoingénierie: UW prof proposes cloud experiment to fight global warming - seattlepi
http://www.seattlepi.com/local/environment/article/UW-prof-proposes-cloud-experiment-to-fight-global-3811429.php

❝proposed experiment is to shoot saltwater particles into the sky, increasing marine clouds' surface area and making the clouds brighten and reflect more sunlight. Clouds already reflect about 50 percent of the sunlight that hits them, but the researchers hypothesize that this experiment may increase clouds' reflexivity to 60 percent❞
