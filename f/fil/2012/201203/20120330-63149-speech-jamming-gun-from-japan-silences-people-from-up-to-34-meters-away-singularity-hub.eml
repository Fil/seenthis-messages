❝This prototype device uses a directional mic to listen to someone talking up to 34 meters away. The gun then plays those sounds back to the talker delayed by just a few tenths of a second. Speakers hearing their own delayed voice suddenly stop talking. Why isn’t exactly well known, but it’s suspected that the brain becomes confused when trying to synchronize what it’s saying to what it’s hearing.❞
