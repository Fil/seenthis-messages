GoldieBlox: The Engineering Toy for Girls by Debbie Sterling — Kickstarter

❝I spent a year doing in-depth research into gender differences and child development to create the concept. My big "aha"? Boys have strong spatial skills, which is why they love construction toys so much. Girls, on the other hand, have superior verbal skills. They love reading, stories, and characters.❞
