Silicon Valley must protect against catastrophic sea-level rise - San Jose Mercury News
http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_20451180/mercury-news-editorial-silicon-valley-must-protect-against

❝shore up the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta's deteriorating 1,300 mile levee system that protects the fresh supply of water that 65 percent of Californians drink. An earthquake could cause the utter failure of the levees in minutes, a catastrophe that could obscure other damage. A break in a strategic location would allow the salt water of the San Francisco Bay to pour into the fresh water of the Delta, destroying the fresh water that provides half of Silicon Valley's supply. This could happen any day. But the state holds the levees hostage to a broader and more controversial comprehensive water plan.❞
