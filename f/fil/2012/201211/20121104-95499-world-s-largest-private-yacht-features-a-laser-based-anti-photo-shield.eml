World's Largest Private Yacht Features a Laser-based Anti-Photo Shield
http://www.petapixel.com/2012/10/28/worlds-largest-private-yacht-features-a-laser-based-anti-photo-shield/

❝Eclipse, the world’s largest private yacht owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, already features a high-tech anti-photography system that uses lasers to seek out and deny cameras.

The system was reportedly installed in the $1B+ ship back in 2009, and uses lasers to scan the surrounding area for digital camera CCD sensors.

When it discovers a camera being pointed at the Eclipse, the system beams a bright light directly into the camera to completely wash out any photograph as it’s being exposed.❞
