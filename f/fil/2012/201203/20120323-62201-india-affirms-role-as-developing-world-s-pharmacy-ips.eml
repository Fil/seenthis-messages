India Affirms Role as Developing World’s Pharmacy - IPS
http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=107126

❝NEW DELHI, Mar. 19, 2012 (IPS) - By allowing a generic manufacturer to produce a patented cancer drug at a fraction of its current cost, India has declared that it is not about to abandon its role as the ‘pharmacy of the world’s poor'.

In a path-breaking move on Mar. 9, India's patent office invoked compulsory licensing (CL) provisions under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules to allow generic drug manufacturer Natco Pharma to produce and sell ‘Nexavar’ in India, a drug developed by the German pharmaceutical giant Bayer to treat liver and kidney cancer.❞
