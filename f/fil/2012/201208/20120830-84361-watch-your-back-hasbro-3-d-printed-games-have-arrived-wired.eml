❝Pocket Tactics is an open source table top game you print yourself — even the dice.
3-D Printers are sometimes called “Santa Claus Machines” because, like Santa, they can create anything imaginable. When used to make actual toys and games, this is especially fitting. The team at Ill Gotten Games is doing just that by creating Pocket Tactics, the first open source miniatures game designed to be manufactured on a 3-D printer.❞
