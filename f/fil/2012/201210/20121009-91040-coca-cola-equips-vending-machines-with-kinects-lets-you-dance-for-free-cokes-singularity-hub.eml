❝Advertising shticks have come a long way, especially for companies like Coca-Cola. In an effort to retain its position as the number 1 global brand, the company has recently equipped vending machines with webcams and Microsoft Kinect sensors.

The goal? To get you to shake your booty, shout and cheer, and show as much passion as possible for free Cokes.❞
