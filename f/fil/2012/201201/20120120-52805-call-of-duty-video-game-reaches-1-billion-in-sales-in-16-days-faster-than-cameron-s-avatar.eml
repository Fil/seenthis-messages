❝The film industry made $84 billion in 2010. Thanks to 3D, Blu-ray, and broadband streaming to  electronic devices, the firm projects that the movie industry will grow 6.1% annually to $113 billion in 2015. In that same window of time, video games, which made $56 billion in 2010, are expected to see 8.2% annual growth to $82 billion. This means that the video game industry is growing at a faster rate and will eventually catch up to film❞
