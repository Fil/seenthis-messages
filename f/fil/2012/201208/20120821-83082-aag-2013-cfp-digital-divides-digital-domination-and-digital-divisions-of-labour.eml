AAG 2013 CFP: Digital Divides, Digital Domination, and Digital Divisions of Labour
http://www.zerogeography.net/2012/08/aag-2013-cfp-digital-divides-digital.html

Association of American Geographers Annual Meeting
9-13 April 2013
Los Angeles

❝the particular asymmetries in the representation and production of spatial information on the geoweb remain opaque and often hidden. This session will focus on the geographies, networks, and power relations of the digital inequalities of the geoweb. We hope to attract research at a range of scales (from the household to the national level) and contexts. Possible topics could include:

- Gatekeepers of digital information
- Demographic or geospatial inequalities
- Invisible exploitation of virtual labor
- Quantitative studies of geoweb representation
- Qualitative studies and virtual ethnographies
- Studies of normative assumptions built into geoweb tools and platforms
- Studies of racialized, gendered, or otherwise exclusionary geoweb spaces
- Differences in internet accessibility (i.e. mappings of broadband or wireless penetration)❞
