Critics of Biotech Crops Proved Wrong - Harvard
http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21807/critics_of_biotech_crops_proved_wrong.html

une défense des #OGM, par Calestous Juma, prof à Harvard, expert aux Nations Unies, membre de la Fondation Bill Gates :

❝the adoption of transgenic crops continues to expand at eight per cent per year (...) the fastest adoption rate of any technology in the history of modern agriculture.
(...) many of its [critics] were wrong to assume from the outset the risks of the technology were likely to outweigh its benefits. Emerging evidence runs counter to those fears.
Over the 1996–2010 period, biotechnology crops have reduced 443 million kilogrammes of pesticide use.
This did not only reduce the spraying of chemicals that destroyed biological diversity, but they also cut down harmful exposure by farmers.
Another major impact of the adoption of biotechnology crops has been reduction of carbon emissions.
In 2010 alone the world reduced 19 billion kilogrammes of carbon dioxide due to the use of biotechnology crops. This is the equivalent to taking about nine million cars off the road. The world also reduced its use of land by 91 million hectares by adopting the crops.❞
