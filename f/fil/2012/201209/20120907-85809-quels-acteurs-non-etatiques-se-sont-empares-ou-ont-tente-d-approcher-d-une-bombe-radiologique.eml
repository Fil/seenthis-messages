Quels "acteurs non-étatiques" se sont emparés (ou ont tenté d'approcher) d'une #bombe radiologique ou nucléaire ?

Database Spotlight: Radiological and Nuclear Non-State Adversaries (RANNSAD) - START - National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism

❝Researchers also determined some key characteristics about the 45 actors profiled in RANNSAD. The majority of these perpetrators were lone actors, all were male and most originated from the United States, Russia or Japan.

In terms of type of actor, most non-state actors with nuclear ambitions were either violent jihadists or part of an apocalyptic cult. Jihadist ideology, mental illness, the desire for publicity, personal vendetta or assassination motivated most non-state actors pursuing or using radiological weapons. Researchers also noted that the majority of plots by these actors are interdicted rather than successful.❞
