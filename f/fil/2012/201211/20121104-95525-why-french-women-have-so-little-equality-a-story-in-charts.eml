Why French women have so little equality, a story in charts
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/10/25/why-french-women-have-so-little-equality-a-story-in-charts/

❝Other than Italy, which has long been accused of treating women relatively poorly, France is by far the worst country for women in Western Europe. (...)
Today, much of the inequality appears to affect women’s political empowerment, for which France ranks 63rd, just beneath Ethiopia. Economic opportunity for French women is similarly low, particularly on wage equality, on which France ranks a stunning 129th in the world. According to the World Economic Forum’s global survey, *France is the absolute worst in the world for gender wage equality*.❞
