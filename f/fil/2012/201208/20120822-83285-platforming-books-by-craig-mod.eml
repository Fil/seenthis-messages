Platforming #Books — by Craig Mod
http://craigmod.com/journal/platforming_books/

❝The future of books is built upon networked platforms, not islands. More than any surface advancement — interface, navigational, typographic, or similar — platforms define how we read going forward. Platforms shape systems — those of production, consumption, distribution — and all critical changes happening in digital books and publishing happen within systems. Post-artifact books and publishing2 is not just about text on screens.❞

❝digital books benefit from public endpoints [websites]. [Readers] have formed expectations about sharing text, and if you obstruct their ability to share — to touch — digital text, then your content is as good as non-existent. (...)
we will sell more digital and physical copies by having all of the content available online❞
