*The Startup Kids*
http://bre.klaki.net/blog/2012/10/01/

❝Saturday was the premier of the Startup Kids, a documentary about young entrepreneurs in Europe and America.

(...)

my biggest beef with the film, was that it and the people interviewed, did nothing to counter the common claim that startups have to be work, work, work and more work.

The American idea that if you want to succeed, you should work 16 hour days and never take a holiday wasn't questioned even once, and the people being interviewed were eager to justify spending all their time at work by talking about how much fun it was and how they loved living with their coworkers, and so on.

The more I read about startups, the more I've become bothered by this, and when combined with an emphasis on youth (read: inexperience and insecurity), it actually takes on a slightly sinister tone.

It's well known that productivity drops off pretty rapidly after 8 hours on the job. It's also well known that working too hard will lead to health problems. I've suffered my own minor break-downs after working too much, and it seems this is a common problem in the startup world.❞
