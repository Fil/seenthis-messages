Food shortages could force world into vegetarianism, warn scientists | The Guardian
http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/26/food-shortages-world-vegetarianism

❝Leading water scientists have issued one of the sternest warnings yet about global food supplies, saying that the world's population may have to switch almost completely to a vegetarian diet over the next 40 years to avoid catastrophic shortages.

Humans derive about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to drop to just 5% to feed the extra 2 billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research by some of the world's leading water scientists.❞
