❝“We’re starting to see nation-state resources and expertise employed in what we would characterize as reckless and disruptive, destructive behaviors,” said NSA Information Assurance Directorate Deborah Plunkett at a recent forum at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University.

Plunkett said even back in the days of the Cold War, nations exhibited some sense of restraint when it came to computerized activities.

“Some of today’s national cyber actors don’t seem to be bound by any sense of restraint,” she noted.❞
