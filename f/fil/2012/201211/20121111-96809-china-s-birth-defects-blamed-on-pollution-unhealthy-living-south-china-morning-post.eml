❝Incidence of problems in newborns has nearly doubled in 15 years❞

(...)

❝ "Pollution is a prevalent problem across our country. In big cities, the quality of air and water is still not satisfactory, even though the authorities have launched campaigns to clean up the environment. In small cities and rural areas, the situation is even worse."

Ma said work pressures and addictions to tobacco, alcohol, hard drugs and online games could also lead to birth defects.❞
