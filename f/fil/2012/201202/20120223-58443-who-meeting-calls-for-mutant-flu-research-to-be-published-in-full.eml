WHO meeting calls for mutant-flu research to be published ‘in full.’
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/02/who-meeting-calls-for-mutant-flu-research-to-be-published-in-full.html

❝A two-day meeting of 22 experts convened in Geneva by the World Health Organization (WHO) has concluded that two controversial flu studies should be published in full. The research — in which ferret-transmissible strains of avian H5N1 flu virus were created — will be published after a delay of probably a few months, which the experts argue is needed to explain better the public-health benefits of the research and allay public concerns over the safety of the work❞
