Epstein is wrong about South Africa's AIDS response
http://www.quackdown.info/article/epstein-wrong-about-south-africas-aids-response/

❝Helen Epstein is an influential journalist and regular contributor to one of the world's most prestigious literary journals, the New York Review of Books (NYRB). It is therefore unsettling that she has written an article on the NYRB blog that contains serious errors about the South African HIV epidemic and the important prevention benefits of antiretroviral treatment❞
