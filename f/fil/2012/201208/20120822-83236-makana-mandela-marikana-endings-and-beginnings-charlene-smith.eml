Makana, Mandela, Marikana — endings and beginnings | Charlene Smith

❝At Marikana we saw the product of a fat and lazy cabinet. At Marikana: in those policemen we saw the result of two corrupt commissioners of police — one of whom was recently released early from jail. Our police are poorly trained, badly equipped, and scared. We saw in Lonmin the sort of uncaring corporate bullying that we see with the banks. And among the miners we saw the desperation the poor experience, we saw in their violence the futile rage that unless South Africans wake up and start pushing for social justice — that rage will sweep across the nation.❞
