#Taiwan, #Japan share atomic power dilemma | The Japan Times Online
http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120411f1.html

❝Taiwan has three nuclear power stations, two in the north and one in the south. All have operated safely and profitably for many years while providing nearly 20 percent of the island's electricity.

But the facilities are getting old — the oldest is slated for decommissioning in 2018 and another in 2019.

Construction of a fourth plant began in 1998 in New Taipei City on the northeast coast, but various shutdowns due to engineering problems and policy reversals have delayed its completion.❞
