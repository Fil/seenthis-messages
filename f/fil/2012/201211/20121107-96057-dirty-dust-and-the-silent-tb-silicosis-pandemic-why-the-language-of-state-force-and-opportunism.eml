Dirty dust and the silent TB – silicosis pandemic…why the language of state force and opportunism misses a key narrative on health, post Marikana -- Fatima Hassan

❝The paper seeks to explain some of the events and narratives arising pre and post #Marikana about the industry, government, mine workers, and in particular, the health rights of workers. She argues that health rights (silicosis, TB and HIV) is a missing  narrative in the general response to Marikana and associated events. While most commentators have sought to explain the political, industrial relations, and economic aspects of Marikana, they have not yet focused significant attention on lung disease caused by mine work and its socio-economic consequences for workers in Southern Africa’s mining communities.❞
