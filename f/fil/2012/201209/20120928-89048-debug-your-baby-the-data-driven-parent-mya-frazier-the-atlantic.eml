"Debug your baby" / The Data-Driven Parent - Mya Frazier - The Atlantic
http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-data-driven-parent/308935/

pour tous les parents 2.0 qui ne sauraient pas quoi faire avec leur #bébé 1.0

❝ THE DAY THEIR SON was born, Monica Rogati and her husband began obsessively plotting his life via thousands of bits of data they punched into the smartphone app Baby Connect. They called the data “baby I/O,” a reference to the computing expression input/output and the kind of “geeky joke,” as Rogati puts it, that you might expect from a pair of professional data crunchers with doctorates from Carnegie Mellon. With the baby’s feedings (input), diapers (output), sleep sessions, and other accomplishments duly registered, he generated 300 data points each month.

(...)

Rogati imagines that this crowdsourcing will provide an early-warning system to help parents determine what is and isn’t out of the ordinary: “He’s in the 50th percentile, he is perfectly normal.” Or “This is in the 99.9th percentile. Maybe this is not normal.” It will be a way, she says matter-of-factly, “to debug your baby for problems.”❞
