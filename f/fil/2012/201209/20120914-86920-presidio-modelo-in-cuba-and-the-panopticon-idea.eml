Presidio Modelo in #Cuba and the #panopticon idea
http://dprbcn.wordpress.com/2009/10/21/presidio-modelo-in-cuba-and-the-panopticon-idea/

❝The last prisoner from Presidio Modelo was released in 1967 and now the old building serves as a museum and is declared a National Monument. Presidio Modelo doesn’t exists anymore as a #prison, but what happens with sites like Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib et al, where fear is used to control and prisoners are incommunicated and abused. Maybe the shape is not circular any more, but the ends are the same as 200 years ago: Architecture to be oppressive – the #architecture of fear.❞
