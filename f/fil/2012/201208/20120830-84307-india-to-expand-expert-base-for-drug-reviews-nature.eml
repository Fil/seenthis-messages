India to expand expert base for drug reviews | Nature
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/08/india-to-expand-expert-base-for-drug-reviews.html

❝The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is looking for experts in multiple areas, including cancer, immunology, pharmacology and vaccines, to help “bring more transparency, consistency and accountability” to drugs approvals in India, according to a letter posted on its website yesterday.

As well as providing advice on potential new drugs and devices, these experts may be asked to draw up guidelines for industry and create a ‘roadmap’ for the development of drugs relevant to the Indian population.❞
