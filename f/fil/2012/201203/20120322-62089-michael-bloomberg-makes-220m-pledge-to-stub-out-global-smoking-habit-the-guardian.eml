Michael Bloomberg makes $220m pledge to stub out global smoking habit | The Guardian
http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/mar/22/michael-bloomberg-smoking-pledge

❝Michael Bloomberg, who introduced a ban on smoking in public places in New York despite warnings that it would destroy tourism and alienate voters, is putting unprecedented sums of money into anti-smoking efforts in poorer parts of the world where the industry is increasingly looking for expansion.

About 80% of deaths from smoking-related diseases last year were in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Lung Foundation's Tobacco Atlas published on Wednesday.❞
