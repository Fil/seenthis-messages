❝who has the capacity to do this? Well, I mean, there's really only one answer and that's the #military.

My best guess is that it will be #China that does it. This has not been revealed yet, but within the last few weeks the Chinese Government included for the very first time geo-engineering research in its top 12 scientific research priorities. ❞

❝There's no doubting the scarily epic nature of such interventions.

CLIVE HAMILTON, CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY: To seize control of the climatic system of the Earth as a whole. This is a massive proposal that humanity is starting to talk about. (...) When you consider the almost total failure of the global community to respond to the science of climate change with anything like the urgency that the science suggests ... I think geo-engineering is virtually inevitable.❞

❝Russ George remains unapologetic about his experiment. He says there's no time to wait for an international treaty. 

RUSS GEORGE: I don't see that happening before the oceans die. Right? The Royal Society of England came out a few years ago and said that by the year 2050 there'd be no harvestable fish left in the ocean. So I don't think we have time.❞
