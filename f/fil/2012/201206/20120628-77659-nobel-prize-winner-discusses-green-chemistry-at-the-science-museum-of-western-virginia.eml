Nobel Prize winner discusses 'green' chemistry at the Science Museum of Western Virginia - Roanoke.com

❝Grubbs is especially excited about the pending launch of a biorefinery in Indonesia — that belongs to a joint venture of which Grubbs is a part — to supply chemicals and fuels from the oil of palm, mustard and soybean plants. A news release by Elevance Renewable Sciences said the goods manufactured at the facility are designed to go in "surfactants, antimicrobials, lubricants, renewable biodiesel and green jet fuels."

Another major thrust of green chemistry is to manufacture compounds identical to insect pheromones, which females emit to attract a mate. A farmer could spread the stuff widely in a field, leaving the males unable to track potential mates on account of sheer confusion, he said. It's been done for the peach twig borer, he said.❞
