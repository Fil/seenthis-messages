❝The operations demonstrate that the drug trafficking organizations have a hold on the African route and are using it to try to get the drug to Europe, Quiros said.

The cartels have forsaken the Mediterranean route, which is much more heavily monitored, mainly across the Strait of Gibraltar, and have ruled out shipping via the North Sea due to the very harsh weather conditions there.

The smuggling vessels can sail along the African coast without making stops, blending in among the fishing boats that operate there along the route between Africa and Europe, or even using African countries such as Guinea-Bissau and Guinea as transit zones where they temporarily stash the merchandise before transferring it to other boats in smaller quantities, Quiros said.

Interpol in 2007 warned that the west coast of Africa was beginning to rival the Caribbean Sea route as maritime entry conduits for introducing cocaine to Europe and the United States, respectively, and five years later the African route is well-established.❞
