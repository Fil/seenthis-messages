❝The Penny Arcade experiment has a humorous tone, but the intent behind it is a serious one. By turning to their readers, Penny Arcade wants to become a totally reader-centric business that answers only to its fans and supporters. In some ways it’s the ultimate extension of the model the New York Times and other traditional publishers have taken with paywalls and other subscription plans, except Penny Arcade has come at it from the opposite direction: instead of hitting readers with a paywall when they try to read something, it is asking for funding up front before the content has even been created.

Targeted publications like the Financial Times and the Economist seem to already be on the road towards this kind of model, with subscriptions surging ahead of advertising to make up more than half of the revenues at the FT in a recent period. Is this a model that other media entities could pursue? Perhaps❞
