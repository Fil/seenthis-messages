Rape, homelessness, cholera hound Haiti 2 yrs after quake -IOM - AlertNet

❝“Free services like water have gone. Non-governmental organisations have had to pull out because of a lack of funding. Donor fatigue has set in. Conditions are really tough,” Leonard Doyle, IOM’s communications officer told AlertNet in a telephone interview from Port-au-Prince.

“You can’t ignore these people who are enduring horrendous conditions. Rape is a big, big problem,” Doyle added. “A plastic tent offers no protection. It just takes a blade using a knife to enter a tent. Some women and girls have been victims of multiple rapes.”

While the number of Haitians living in camps has decreased by 66 percent from a July 2010  peak of 1.5 million, the pace of people leaving the camps has slowed recently. Over the last four months, the camp population has fallen by only 6 percent.❞
