Israel’s Biometric Database Deemed “Harmful” by High Court Justices | Electronic Frontier Foundation
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/israels-biometric-database-deemed-harmful-high-court-justices

❝In Israel, a heated debate is underway about whether Israel’s Interior Ministry will move ahead with the creation of a governmental biometric database containing digital fingerprints and facial photographs, which would be linked to “smart” national ID cards containing microchips. At the heart of the issue is a major concern about privacy: Aggregated personal information invites security breaches, and large databases of biometric information can be honeypots of sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation.❞
