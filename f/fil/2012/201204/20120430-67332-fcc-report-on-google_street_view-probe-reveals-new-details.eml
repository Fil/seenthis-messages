❝It "wasn't some engineering mistake," Chester said.

According to the report, the Google engineer, who was not a full-time member of the team but was working on Street View as a side project, wrote the code in 2006. He was interested in collecting data from unencrypted wireless networks to see if the data could be used in Google's other products and services. The data provided a snapshot of what people were doing online when the Street View cars drove by.❞
