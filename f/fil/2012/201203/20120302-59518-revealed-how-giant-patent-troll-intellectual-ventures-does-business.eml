du nouveau sur le #troll à #brevets Nathan Myhrwold

❝Intellectual Ventures has between 30,000 and 60,000 #patents. That's a rough estimate. But even the low number makes Intellectual Ventures (IV) the 5th largest patent portfolio of any U.S. company, and 15th in the world. Nearly all of those patents originated elsewhere. IV does very little inventing of its own.
It uses more than 1,200 shell companies.❞
