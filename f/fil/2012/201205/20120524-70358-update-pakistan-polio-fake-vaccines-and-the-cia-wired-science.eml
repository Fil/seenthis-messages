Update: Pakistan, Polio, Fake Vaccines And The CIA | Wired Science
http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/05/pakistan-polio-fake-cia/#more-112151

❝Regular readers will remember my outraged rant post from almost a year ago, reacting to the news that the Central Intelligence Agency faked a vaccination campaign in Pakistan as a way of getting close to Osama Bin Laden’s hide-out, hoping to prove his presence by using a vaccine needle to grab a sample of DNA.
(...)
I take no pleasure in saying the prediction came true. Both The Guardian and the news website OnIslam reported in March that polio eradication in Pakistan — one of the three countries where polio stubbornly persists because of internal conflict — has been hampered by the fake campaign.❞
