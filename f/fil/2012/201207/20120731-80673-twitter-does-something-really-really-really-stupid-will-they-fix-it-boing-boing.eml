#Twitter does something really, really, really stupid - will they fix it? - Boing Boing
http://boingboing.net/2012/07/30/twitter-does-something-really.html

❝Twitter suspended Guy Adams, a journalist from the UK paper The Independent after Adams posted the email address of an NBC exec and urged his followers to send in email complaining about the network's (shamefully bad) handling of its Olympics broadcasts. Dan Gillmor in the Guardian has some context about how totally, boneheadedly stupid Twitter is being here, and what they need to do to fix it.❞
