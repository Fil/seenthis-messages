Pervasive #Mobile Technologies: Meet Our Grey Market Devices! — Centre for Internet and Society

❝Pervasive technologies that can be purchased for less than USD 100 play an integral role in bringing access to knowledge to those that routinely face barriers to the consumption of information.

However, their legality, particularly in terms of their use of IP, is unclear. In order to better understand the legal environment in which these technologies exist, CIS purchased 12 grey market [1] mobile phones to study the patent implications of their hardware, software and content.❞
