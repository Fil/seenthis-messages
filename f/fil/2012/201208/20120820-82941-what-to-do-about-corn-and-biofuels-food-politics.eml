What to do about corn and #biofuels | Food Politics
http://www.foodpolitics.com/2012/08/to-ponder-over-the-weekend-what-to-do-about-corn-and-biofuels/

❝Among the other consequences of the current drought—along with the ruin of this year’s corn crop—is a complicated political battle over who gets the corn.

The players:

- Corn producers: Want high prices.  Don’t care whether meat or ethanol producers get the corn.  Note: Many own their own ethanol refineries.
- Meat producers: Want the corn at low prices.  Do not want corn grown for ethanol.  Want the ethanol quota waived.
- Ethanol producers: Want the corn at low prices.  Want to keep the quota.
- International aid agencies: Want corn to be grown for food and feed, not fuel.  Want the ethanol quota waived.❞
