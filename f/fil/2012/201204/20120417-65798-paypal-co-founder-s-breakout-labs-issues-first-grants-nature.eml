#PayPal co-founder’s Breakout Labs issues first grants : Nature

❝Thiel conceived of Breakout Labs to try to remedy what he sees as a failure of imagination in modern scientific and technological innovation: “We wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters,” ❞

bon il a raison, mais c'est un peu de sa faute : lui-même a inventé un porte-monnaie… et financé quantité de start-ups à la noix

❝Breakout Labs, run by the Thiel Foundation based in San Francisco, California, was announced in November and awards grants of up to US$350,000 each to companies that “dream big and want to build a tomorrow in which we all want to live,” Thiel said in a press release. The programme aims “to fill the funding gap that exists for innovative research outside the confines of an academic institution, large corporation, or government.”❞
