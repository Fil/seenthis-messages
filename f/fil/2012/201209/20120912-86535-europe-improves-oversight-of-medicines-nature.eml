Europe improves oversight of medicines : Nature
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/09/europe-improves-oversight-of-medicines.html

❝The European Union (EU) has tightened oversight rules for drugs, in response to the scandal over anti-diabetic medicine Mediator that erupted in France two years ago (press release).

The European Parliament and EU council of ministers yesterday agreed amendments to a regulation and directive making evaluation and possible market withdrawal of a drug automatic throughout the EU if a safety alert is issued in one of the 27 member states.❞
