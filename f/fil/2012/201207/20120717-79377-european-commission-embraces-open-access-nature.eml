European Commission embraces #open-access : Nature
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/07/european-commission-embraces-open-access.html

❝The European Commission has announced its intention to make open-access all the research findings funded by its enormous €80-billion 2014-2020 research-funding programme, Horizon 2020. And it is urging member states to follow its lead.

Under proposals announced in Brussels this morning, articles would either be made immediately accessible online, with the Commission paying up-front publication costs (expected to be 1% of the total research budget); or researchers could make their articles available through an open-access repository no later than six months after publication (or 12 months for social sciences and humanities). The Commission has already developed such a repository – the OpenAIRE repository.

Sound familiar? Yes, it’s an almost identical copy of the UK’s open-access policy, announced yesterday.❞
