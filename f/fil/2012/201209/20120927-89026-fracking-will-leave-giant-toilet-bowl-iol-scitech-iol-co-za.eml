❝Pastor Barry Wuganaale, a member of the Ogoni Solidarity Forum, told the group he had lived in the Niger Delta, where the land of the Ogoni people had been horribly polluted by oil. “One thing our Ogoni people in the Niger Delta are rich in is our appalling experience with Shell. I would be doing a disservice to mankind if I did not share it.

“Africa has been raped. The scars of environmental rape will haunt generations afterwards, so don’t allow it [fracking]. We Ogoni people have resisted Shell without any legislation. You have legislation backing you, you have freedom of the press, exploit it,” Wuganaale said.❞
