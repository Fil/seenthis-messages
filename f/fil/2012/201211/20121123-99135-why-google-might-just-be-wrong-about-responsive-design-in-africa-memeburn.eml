❝
- Most Africans do not have internet at home or at work. Only about 15% of the population does. And the internet that they have at home and work is not at all comparable with what you have in America (in terms of speed and reliability).
- Smartphone penetration in Africa is less than 20%.
- Public Wi-Fi Hotspots are not widely available.
- The GDP and PPP in Africa is among the lowest in the world.
So your typical African’s first and only point of access to the internet is via a feature phone. Because of the cost of data and the disposable income of a typical African, an African *feature phone* internet user is very aware of the size and cost of a web page.❞


❝What we need in Africa is a solution that is lightweight in terms of data usage.❞

❝[with #proactive_design] an African user can surf the net 10 times more (or at a cost that is 10 times less) and 10 times faster [than with #responsive_design].❞
