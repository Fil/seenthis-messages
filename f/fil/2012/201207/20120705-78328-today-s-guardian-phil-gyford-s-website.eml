❝I’ve made a new thing, Today’s Guardian, a website that features today’s edition of the Guardian (or the Observer on Sundays). Hopefully it’s as easy to browse through today’s newspaper as it would be with the print edition. It’s made using the Guardian’s Content API. Read on for the thoughts behind it…❞

❝I wanted something with *reduced friction*. There should be as few difficult decisions as possible, nothing harder than “shall I turn the page?”.  (...)
I also wanted something with *high readability*. No clutter around the articles
(...)
Finally, I wanted *finishability*. I wanted to be able to read today’s news, know I’d read it all, and that I’m done until tomorrow.❞
