Mysterious Vienna death of Gaddafi oil boss arouses suspicion | Reuters
http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/01/libya-ghanem-idUSL5E8G12ZR20120501

❝Ghanem, who was also close to Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam, was privy to potentially damaging information including on oil deals with Western governments and oil companies. Such deals are now under investigation by Libya's new leaders.

As chairman of Libya's National Oil Company (NOC) since 2006, Ghanem helped steer Libya's oil policy and held the high-profile job of representing Libya at OPEC meetings in Vienna.

"I think he knows more about what really went on in NOC than anyone else alive - not alive now, he's dead. Obviously there are matters there that would not pass muster in a normal society. Where was all the money going?" said the former OPEC minister who asked not to be named.❞
