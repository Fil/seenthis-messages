Programmers Don't Read Books -- But You Should
http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/04/programmers-dont-read-books----but-you-should.html

❝top five programming books every working programmer should own -- and read. These seminal books are richly practical reads, year after year, no matter what kind of programming I'm doing. They reward repeated readings, offering deeper and more penetrating insights into software engineering every time I return to them, armed with a few more years of experience under my belt. If you haven't read these books, what are you waiting for?
