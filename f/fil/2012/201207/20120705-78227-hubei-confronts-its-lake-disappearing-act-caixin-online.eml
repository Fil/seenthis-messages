Hubei Confronts Its Lake Disappearing Act - Caixin Online
http://english.caixin.com/2012-07-03/100406919.html

❝The province has been losing its once-bountiful lakes for about 100 years, but the destructive pace accelerated in modern times with extension draining projects for farmland and the expansion of water-dependent heavy industry.
Today, the total surface area of all provincial lakes is just 3,025 square kilometers, according to official statistics, compared to some 26,000 square kilometers of water in the early 1900s, when Hubei was called The Province of 1,000 Lakes.❞
