❝What must a DMS do?

A mature DMS will let people do all the following things:

Load and update data from any source (ETL)
Store datasets and index them for querying
View, analyse and update data in a tabular interface (spreadsheet)
Visualise data, for example with charts or maps
Analyse data, for example with statistics and machine learning
Organise many people to enter or correct data (crowd-sourcing)
Measure and ensure the quality of data, and its provenance
Permissions; data can be open, private or shared
Find datasets, and organise them to help others find them
Sell data, sharing processing costs between users❞



❝In short, it’s what the elite data wrangling teams inside places like #Wolfram Alpha and Google’s #Metaweb teams do. But made easier and more visible using standardised tools and protocols.
../..
Windows / OSX (+ Excel / #LibreOffice / …) – the desktop serves as a (good enough so far) DMS
CKAN software – started as a data catalog, but has grown into more and powers the DataHub, a community data hub and market. Created by the Open Knowledge Foundation
ScraperWiki- coming from the viewpoint of a programmer, good at ETL
Infochimps/DataMarket – approaching it as a data marketplace
BuzzData – specialising in the social aspects
Tableau Public – specialising in visualisation
Google Spreadsheets – coming from the web spreadsheet direction
Microsoft Data Hub – corporate information management
PANDA – making a DMS for newsrooms❞
