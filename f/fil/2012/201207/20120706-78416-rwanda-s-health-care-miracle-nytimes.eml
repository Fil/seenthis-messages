Rwanda's Health Care Miracle - NYTimes
http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/rwandas-health-care-miracle/

❝health coverage for all. All other developed countries have it. But so do some developing nations — Brazil, Thailand, Chile. These countries are mostly middle income. But one country on the list is among the poorest of the poor: Rwanda.

The point is not that Americans should envy Rwanda’s health system — far from it. But Rwanda’s experience illustrates the value of universal health insurance.

(...) Kagame is also widely admired as the most effective leader in Africa. A country in ashes 18 years ago is now safe and clean. It is one of the least corrupt countries in Africa. Per capita income has tripled — although the fact that it is now only $550 a year tells you how destitute Rwanda was.

Its most impressive gains, however, have been in health.❞
