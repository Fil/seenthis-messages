Drug-resistant #malaria strain in Myanmar is global threat

❝The world must help Myanmar fight a drug-resistant strain of malaria that could kill up to 200,000 children a year if it reaches India and Africa, a veteran health worker in the Southeast Asian country has warned.

But Frank Smithuis, former head of medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Myanmar, said major donors had excluded the country from their anti-malaria programmes, seriously jeopardising a concerted international effort to contain the epidemic.❞
