The Rule of Transformation

❝Lang claims that he has been displaying and even selling his fold patterns as art for years. Morris claims she has been painting found patterns like this for years, and that she "transforms" the found piece into something new. (...) "Is it bettered by the borrower?" In this case, yes.❞
