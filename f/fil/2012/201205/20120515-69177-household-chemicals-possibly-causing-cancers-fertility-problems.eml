http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=144348

❝The significant growth in many human diseases and disorders in recent decades, including breast and prostate cancer, male infertility and diabetes is connected to the rising levels of exposure to mixtures of some chemicals in widespread use, according to a review of recent literature commissioned by the European Environment Agency (EEA).

Chemicals which disrupt the hormone system – also known as ‘endocrine disrupting chemicals’ (EDCs) – can be found in food, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, household products and cosmetics.❞
