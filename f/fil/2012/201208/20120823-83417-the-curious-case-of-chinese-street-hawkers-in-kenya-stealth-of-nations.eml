The Curious Case of Chinese Street Hawkers in Kenya | stealth of nations
http://stealthofnations.blogspot.fr/2012/08/the-curious-case-of-chinese-street.html

❝after the economic crash of 2008 and 2009, many Chinese firms that had previously relied on African middlemen coming to China to buy, changed their strategies and started sending sales representatives directly to Africa. I  met some of them in Nigeria. And it's only one step from that to sending people to Africa to take care of the retailing.

Still, what interests me here is that the hawkers -- many of whom are unlicensed -- have petitioned the government to crack down on the Chinese, who they claim have no work permits.❞
