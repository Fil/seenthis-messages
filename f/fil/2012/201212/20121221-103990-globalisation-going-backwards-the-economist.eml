Globalisation: Going backwards | The Economist
http://www.economist.com/news/business/21568753-world-less-connected-it-was-2007-going-backwards?fsrc=scn%2Ftw%2Fte%2Fpe%2Fgoingbackwards

❝the world is less integrated in 2012 than it was back in 2007. These are the conclusions of the latest DHL Global Connectedness Index, which found that the Netherlands is the most globalised of 140 countries (see chart), just ahead of Singapore; landlocked Burundi is the least. (North Korea was not ranked.)

(...) no group overestimates global connectedness more than company bosses.❞
