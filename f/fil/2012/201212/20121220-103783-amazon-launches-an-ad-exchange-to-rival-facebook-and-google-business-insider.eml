#Amazon Launches An Ad Exchange To Rival #Facebook And #Google - Business Insider

❝Amazon has created a real-time bidding ad exchange (...)
Here's how it will work: If you're browsing on Amazon but decide not to buy that DVD of "Star Wars," Amazon will drop a #tracking #cookie on your browser. When you go elsewhere in Amazon's exchange network -- which includes Amazon, #IMDb, DPReview, and various ad exchanges and publishers that Amazon has a relationship with -- you might see an ad pop up offering you another chance to buy "Star Wars."❞
