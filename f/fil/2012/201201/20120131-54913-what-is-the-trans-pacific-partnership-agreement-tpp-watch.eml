What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement? « #TPP Watch
http://tppwatch.org/what-is-tppa/

❝What is in the proposed agreement?

We don’t exactly know because the negotiations are secret and the only documents that are in the public domain have been leaked. Worse still, the nine governments agreed that none of the background documents will be released until four years after the negotiations end (or collapse), so we won’t be able to hold them accountable for any tradeoffs they make until they are no longer in power.

What kind of policies could be targeted in the negotiations?

We know from various sources that they include

stronger restrictions on foreign investments
tobacco control laws
restrictions on sale and manufacture of GMOs and labeling of GM foods
the Pharmac scheme for buying drugs and subsidies
the ability to reverse privatisations in the future
stronger regulation of mining
parallel importing, especially for music and computer programmes
Intellectual property protection in the digital media
hot money flows in and out of the country.❞
