Amazing new declassified document from John Nash
http://aaronsadventures.blogspot.com/2012/02/amazing-new-declassified-document.html

❝this is a recently declassified correspondence between John Nash and the NSA from January 1955. In it, John Nash makes the distinction between polynomial time and exponential time, conjectures that there are problems that -cannot- be solved faster than in exponential time, and uses this conjecture as the basis on which  the security of a cryptosystem (of his own design) relies. He also anticipates that proving complexity lower bounds is a difficult mathematical problem
(...)
These letters predate even Godel's letter to Von Neumann
(...)
“An interesting pamphlet on Non-Cooperative Games, written by Mr. Nash was also sent to this Agency by the author for our information."❞
