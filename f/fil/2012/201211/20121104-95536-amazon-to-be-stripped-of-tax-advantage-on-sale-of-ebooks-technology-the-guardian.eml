#Amazon to be stripped of tax advantage on sale of ebooks | Technology | The Guardian
http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/24/amazon-tax-loophole-ebooks

❝Amazon is to be stripped of its huge tax advantage on the sales of electronic books after the European commission ordered Luxembourg to close a VAT loophole.

Amazon is registered as a Luxembourg company and pays that country's VAT charge of 3% when it sells an ebook to a British reader, rather than the 20% it would have to charge if it were UK-based.❞
