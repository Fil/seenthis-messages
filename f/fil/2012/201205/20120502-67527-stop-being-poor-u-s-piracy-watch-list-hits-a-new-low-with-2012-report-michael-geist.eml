Stop Being Poor: U.S. Piracy Watch List Hits A New Low With 2012 Report | Michael Geist
http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6456/125/

❝the most shameful inclusion in this year's report are a series of countries whose primarily fault is being poor.  For example, the list includes Guatemala, a small country the size of Tennessee with a per capita GDP of just over $5,000. It is coming out of an economic depression that had a severe impact on rural income.  (...)

The same tactic is employed against countries such as Costa Rica (81st per capita GDP with complaints that more resources should be allocated to enforcement) or Romania (77th per capita GDP with complaints about more resources on enforcement). Moreover, with repeated complaints against countries seeking to ensure adequate access to medicines for their citizens or access to books in schools, this year's report hits a new low. It demonstrates the failure of the enforcement agenda and stands as an embarrassment for one of the world's richest countries to prioritize its IP rights over human and economic rights in the developing world.❞
