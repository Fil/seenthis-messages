Don Knuth versus #Email
http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html

❝I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I'd used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime.

Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible #concentration. I try to learn certain areas of computer #science exhaustively; then I try to digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don't have time for such study.❞
