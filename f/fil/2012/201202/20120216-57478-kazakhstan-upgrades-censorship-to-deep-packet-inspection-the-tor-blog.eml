#Kazakhstan upgrades censorship to deep packet inspection | The #Tor Blog
https://blog.torproject.org/blog/kazakhstan-upgrades-censorship-deep-packet-inspection

❝In December 2011 we were aware of Kazakhstan increasing Internet censorship in response to some unrest and protests in Zhanaozen in the west.  (...)
Luckily, due to our recent experience with #Iran we have an answer for people: use obfsproxy. Obfsproxy continues to work in Kazakhstan, as well as Iran. In fact, it works in any country where dpi is used to censor citizens' access to the #Internet.❞
