M-PESA: The Story of the Most Successful Bank in #Kenya - Massimo Young - Freakonomics

❝It’s not easy to do business in #Kenya. [but] the wild success of #mobile_banking in Kenya has changed the way people use money here. Launched just 5 years ago, Kenya’s leading #mobile money transfer service, M-PESA, now processes a total of about $5 billion in transactions per year, equivalent to an astounding 15% of the country’s GDP. Before it launched, only 14% of Kenyans participated in the formal banking sector. Today, about half the adult population uses M-PESA.❞
