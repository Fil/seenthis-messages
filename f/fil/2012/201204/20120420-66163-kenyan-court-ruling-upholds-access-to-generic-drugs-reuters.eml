Kenyan court ruling upholds access to generic drugs | Reuters
http://af.reuters.com/article/kenyaNews/idAFL6E8FK8FS20120420

❝Kenya's High court ruled on Friday that lawmakers must review legislation that could threaten the import of generic drugs, allowing Kenyans to continue accessing affordable medicine.

Three people living with HIV filed a lawsuit in 2009 that said Kenya's Anti-Counterfeit Bill of 2008 was unconstitutional because it threatened access to life-saving generic medicine by confusing generic and fake medicine.❞

une confusion qui n'est pas due au hasard
