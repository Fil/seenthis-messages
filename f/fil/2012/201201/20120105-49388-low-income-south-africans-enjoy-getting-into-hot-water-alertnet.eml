Low-income South Africans enjoy getting into hot water - AlertNet
http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/low-income-south-africans-enjoy-getting-into-hot-water

❝South Africa is responsible for 70 percent of Africa’s carbon emissions. As the host of the two-week U.N. climate talks, which ended on Dec. 11, the country has been eager to demonstrate its commitment to low-carbon technology.
(...)
Since December 2010, more than 75,000 solar water heaters have been installed by the Gauteng-based Solar Academy of Subsaharan Africa (SASSA), a private company working for the government, in neighbourhoods whose residents cannot normally afford hot water.
(...)
SASSA, which distributes Tasol-brand solar water heaters, claims to be the first company in the world to have registered a programme to earn credits from mass solar water heating installation under the United Nations’ Clean Development Mechanism.❞
