stealth of nations: rational, economic, and wrong
http://stealthofnations.blogspot.fr/2012/09/rational-economic-and-wrong.html

❝Cairo is desperate to promote tourism and investment. Tourists, you can be sure, don't want to visit a Cairo bereft of street vendors. While the cacophony can seem chaotic and bewildering, it is also an indelible part of the Cairene experience. There's an economic value in that as well.❞
