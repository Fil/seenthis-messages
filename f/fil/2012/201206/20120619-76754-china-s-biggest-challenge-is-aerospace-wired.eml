China's Biggest Challenge Is Aerospace | Wired
http://www.wired.com/business/2012/06/st_essay_china_aerospace/

❝China would very much like a piece of this—to have Boeings, NASAs, Cessnas, and fully fledged GPS systems of its own. The 12th Five-Year Plan lists aerospace as a symbol and target of China’s “high-value” ambition. Over the next few years, the country will attempt to re-create all of America’s 100-year aerospace history (...) [they are] trying to do it all, with *100 airports under construction*, several airliner models being developed, and a business-jet culture taking hold.❞
