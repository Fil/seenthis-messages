Tide of plastic bags that started wave of revulsion | Environment | The Guardian
http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/dec/29/plastic-bags-pacific-waste-revulsion

le remplacement des sacs en plastique jetables par des alternatives plus écolos ne serait pas si évident que ça

❝As with so many environmental "improvements", however, banning and charging for plastic bags has not been without controversy: earlier this year an unpublished report by the Environment Agency was leaked, showing that popular alternatives to plastic bags needed to be used many times over to generate less carbon pollution: paper bags at least four times, and cotton bags more than 171 times over.❞
