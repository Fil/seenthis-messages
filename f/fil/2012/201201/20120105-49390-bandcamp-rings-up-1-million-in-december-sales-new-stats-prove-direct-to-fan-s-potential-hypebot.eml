http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2012/01/bandcamp-rings-up-1-million-in-december-sales-new-stats-show-direct-to-fans-potential-.html

❝New numbers from Bandcamp show that in December alone artists using the site grossed more than $1 million in music and merch sales, bringing the total to-date to $12.6 million. 
(...)
"someone spent $10 after following a link on The Pirate Bay, next to the plea: They sell their album as a download on their website. You can even choose your format (mp3, ogg, flac, etc). Cmon, support this awesome band!”❞
