Ruth’s Reviews – “The Information” - James Gleick : Nature
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/ruths-reviews-the-information.html

❝It is charming to read the excitement and fear these advances engender. The excitement of being able to send text at speed was met by a fear that this would mean the death of newspapers. One journalist is quoted, worrying that “intelligence, thus hastily gathered, and transmitted, has also its drawbacks, and is not so trustworthy as the news which starts later and travels slower”. This will sound familiar to anyone concerned with the rise of the internet and citizen reporting today.❞
