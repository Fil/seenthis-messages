❝For a period of 2 years, tree benches stayed successively in front of my house, but they disappeared one after the other. Some of my neighbours encouraged me to organize a "public bench fabrication day", which we did this 15 April 2012. Around 12 benches were created that day and placed along the street. Some benches were decorated using pyrography.❞
