❝How long will our society allow the mining industry to ruin the lives of poor South Africans? How long will our society allow the mining industry to rake millions out of the South African economy while leaving destitute the very people whose labour it exploited in the process? If the events at Lonmin are anything to go by, one day the South Africa working class will take matters into its own hands. And by that time it will no longer be armed with spears and knobkerries. It will long have realised that the power of the mine bosses is their relationship with the government and its gun-toting police.❞
