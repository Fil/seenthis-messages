The Case for a Financial #WikiLeaks | Ian Fraser
http://www.ianfraser.org/how-financial-whistleblowers-can-avoid-being-stabbed-in-the-back/

❝But fear of being ostracised for “spoiling the party”, coupled with an attachment to the high pay that a financial career can bring (you might call it ‘moral cowardice’) is sufficient to persuade the vast majority of putative whistleblowers to keep schtoom.
That’s why I believe we need a financial version of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. It would protect employees from management retribution and eliminate the social barriers to speaking out.❞
