Apostles of Civilised Vice | Zackie Achmat, 1999

❝Queer history?! The histories of lesbian and gay people in South Africa have been confined to an “invisible archive”. Apostles of Civilised Vice is a history of same-sex desire which investigates lesbian and gay experience and personalities from colonial times to the present. Between 1910 and 1933 thousands of men were convicted of sodomy and “unnatural offences”. The majority of those tried, convicted and imprisoned were black. For over two centuries of South African history, lesbian and gay stories have been silenced, depriving contemporary queer life of a history. Apostles of Civilised Vice gives voice to gays and lesbians silenced by colonial rule and apartheid laws that criminalised and marginalised same sex desire.❞
