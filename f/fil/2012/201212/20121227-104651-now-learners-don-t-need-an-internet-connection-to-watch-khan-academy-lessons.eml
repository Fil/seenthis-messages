Now Learners Don’t Need An Internet Connection To Watch Khan Academy Lessons

❝It’s easy in this day and age to get the impression that everyone in the world is connected to the web, but that’s far from the case. In fact, statistics from the International Telecommunication Union show that only 35 percent of the world are considered Internet users. That’s 4.5 billion people who are not online (...)

KA Lite currently works by syncing data between devices and a central server that stores all the content. The server can be set up via a web app once and then cloned to other devices offline (although making this smoother is in the works). Using Wi-Fi or cellular networks, transmitted data are tagged with an anonymous key that acts as a signature for each device. (...) it is an open source project.❞
