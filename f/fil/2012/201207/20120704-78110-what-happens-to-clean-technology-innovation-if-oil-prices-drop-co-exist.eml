What Happens To Clean Technology Innovation If Oil Prices Drop? | Co.Exist
http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680107/what-happens-to-clean-technology-innovation-if-oil-prices-drop

❝a new report (PDF) from Leonard Maugeri, a former oil executive and current fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, warns: "oil supply capacity is growing worldwide at such an unprecedented level that it might outpace consumption. This could lead to a glut of overproduction and a steep dip in oil prices." That dip in oil prices would mean cheaper gas, certainly, but it could put a serious damper on how far we’ve come in the search for non-fossil-fuel-based energy solutions.❞
