❝DHO Chief Dr Bibek Kumar Lal complained that the centres have run out of medicines like Metro Nirajel, Paracetamol, Kotrin Jink, Iron tablet, Amoxicillin, Megapan, Metro injection and others. He said consumption of filthy water was to blame for the outbreak. Health centres are facing an acute shortage of medicines and the number of patients was soaring. 
Meanwhile, local Sunita Bishwokarma said that have been referred to private clinic to buy medicines. “We are compelled to pay huge amount of money for the drugs which otherwise the government provides for free,” she said.❞
