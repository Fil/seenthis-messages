Gates contributes $750 million to Global Fund

❝#Bill_Gates has contributed $750 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in an effort to encourage other donors after the fund experienced problems with financial monitoring and extensive losses. (...) Gates downplayed the reported losses of tens of millions of dollars to undocumented spending, corruption and misuse (...) “These are tough economic times, but that is no excuse for cutting aid to the world’s poorest,” ... “If you’re going to do business in Africa, you’re going to have some losses.”❞
