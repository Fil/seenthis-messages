40% of workers had no dosimeter at nuke plant soon after disaster - AJW by The Asahi Shimbun
http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201209040060

❝TEPCO records show 7,766 people worked at the Fukushima No. 1 plant between March 15 and March 31, 2011, and 3,077, or about 40 percent, did not have a dosimeter.

The actual number of workers is estimated to be in the hundreds because the same individuals were counted more than once if they worked on different occasions.

During the 17-day period, only the representative of a working group wore a dosimeter, and all members of the working group entered the reading of the representative’s dosimeter into their records as their own.

It was an emergency measure because most of the 5,000 dosimeters at the plant were washed away by the tsunami.

Some workers told The Asahi Shimbun that their representatives stayed at least 10 meters from their nearest approach.❞
