Disaster losses set to outpace economic growth - AlertNet
http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/disaster-losses-set-to-outpace-economic-growth-study

❝Damage caused by disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, is outpacing wealth creation and efforts to protect people and assets in many places, according to the briefing from the UK-based Climate and Development Knowledge Network.

"Economic exposure to disasters is increasing faster than per capita gross domestic product (GDP), and the impacts of climate change on the severity and frequency of hazards will accentuate existing trends in disaster losses in the future," it says.❞
