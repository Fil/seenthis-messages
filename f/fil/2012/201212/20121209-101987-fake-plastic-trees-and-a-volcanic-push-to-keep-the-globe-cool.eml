❝#Geoengineering, with its #science_fiction overtones, is considered a risky last resort, because while it might be able to slow or deflect some warming, it wouldn't deal with other effects of rising carbon dioxide levels, such as ocean acidification.
(...) Geoengineering can be divided into two types: reflecting more of the sun's heat away from the Earth, and sucking more heat-trapping greenhouse gases out of the air.
The first type includes some wildly ambitious schemes, such as trying to ''shade'' part of Greenland from the sun's heat with space-based mirrors, an idea with no credible backing among the world's scientists.❞
