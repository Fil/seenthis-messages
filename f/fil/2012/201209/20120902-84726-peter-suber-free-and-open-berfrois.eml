❝Open Access [OA] can be delivered by peer-reviewed journals (in the jargon, “gold” OA) or by repositories (“green” OA).
OA journals can use any of a dozen different business models for paying their bills. (OA does not presuppose that publishing is costless.)  OA publishers can be for-profit or non-profit. Some use traditional methods of peer review, in order to tweak just the access variable of scholarly journals. But others use new and innovative models of peer review taking advantage of the digital network for gathering and disseminating peer judgments. More than 8,000 peer-reviewed OA journals are now listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals.❞

❝We don’t expect copyright-holder consent from musicians, novelists, movie-makers, or other creators who hope to make a living by selling their work. (Despite this, we do get consent from some of them.)❞
