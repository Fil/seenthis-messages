US accused of telecoms pact ‘propaganda’ - FT

"propagande de guerre"

❝Franco Bernabè, chairman of Telecom Italia and president of GSMA, the mobile operators' association, has attacked what he described as “propaganda warfare” by the US that led to the collapse last week of talks over a telecom treaty.
(...)
Mr Bernabè, who as president of GSMA represents almost 800 mobile operators in 220 countries, said the suggestion by the US and its allies that those in favour of the treaty were from “authoritarian regimes” was “ridiculous”. 
“This is *propaganda warfare*,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “What is offensive is [the idea] that a legitimate portion of the industry has been associated with Iran and oppressive regimes. That is complete nonsense and unacceptable”. 
Mr Bernabè, calling for regulators to reconsider their stance, joined other supporters of the treaty in suggesting that the US was using the principle of freedom as a cover to protect corporations such as #Google and #Facebook from global attempts to co-ordinate regulation.
