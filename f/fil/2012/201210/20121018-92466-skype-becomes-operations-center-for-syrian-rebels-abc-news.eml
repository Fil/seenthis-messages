#Skype Becomes Operations Center for Syrian Rebels - ABC News
http://abcnews.go.com/International/skype-operations-center-syrian-rebels/story?id=17395589

❝Skype is a new battleground.

Over the 19-month conflict, the internet has become the operations center for Syria's opposition, as forces fighting the regime use it to plan and document battles, then share information with the public.

"When the uprising began Skype is what people were familiar with, so Skype is what they used. Today it is a communications backbone," said John Scott-Railton, a doctoral student at UCLA and expert on internet freedom.❞
