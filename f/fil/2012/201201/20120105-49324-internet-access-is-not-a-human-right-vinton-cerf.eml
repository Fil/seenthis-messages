Internet Access Is Not a Human Right - Vinton Cerf
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/opinion/internet-access-is-not-a-human-right.html?_r=2&src=tp

❝technology is an enabler of rights, not a right itself. 
(...) It is a mistake to place any particular technology in this exalted category, since over time we will end up valuing the wrong things. 
(...)
engineers have not only a tremendous obligation to empower users, but also an obligation to ensure the safety of users online.
(...)
Improving the Internet is just one means, albeit an important one, by which to improve the human condition. It must be done with an appreciation for the civil and human rights that deserve protection — without pretending that access itself is such a right.❞
