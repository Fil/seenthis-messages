Sauver la vieille #science-fiction | Singularity & Co
http://singularityand.co/thebigidea/

❝we love sci-fi books, new and old.  But mostly old.
 And there are a lot of great old sci-fi books out there that are out of print, out of circulation, and, worst of all, not available in any sort of digital format.
Given the subject material, that’s just not right.
So here’s what we’re going to do.  We’re going to open a bookshop, both online and and in real life
(...) let us choose one great out of print work of classic and/or obscure sci-fi a month, track down the people that hold the copyright (if they are still around), and publish that work online and on all the major digital book platforms for little or no cost❞
