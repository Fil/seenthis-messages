❝Ingress is also the answer to a question: how do we get users to help improve what is already the best mapping system available? With the release of Ingress, tens of thousands of formerly couch locked nerds (such as myself) are now gleefully clocking miles on their pedometers, walking back alleys and park paths with a GPS device recording the entire trip. While Google’s map cars have gone everywhere that can be driven, Google now has their users filling in the gaps between streets.

At the end of the day, this more than anything else is the genius of Google: they inspire their audience to enthusiastically participate in an opt-in experience which would be considered massively intrusive by anyone else, or presented in any other way. They look at problems as opportunities which their users can help solve if given sufficient incentive, and that incentive is generally an enhanced user experience or new service.❞
