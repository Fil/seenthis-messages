❝Even if no documents are found or released, the CIA’s rules now allow it to charge up to $72 dollars per hour of review time.  Furthermore, each requester must now agree to pay a minimum of $15 dollars before the CIA will even accept their request — again, that’s regardless if the CIA finds or releases anything.❞
