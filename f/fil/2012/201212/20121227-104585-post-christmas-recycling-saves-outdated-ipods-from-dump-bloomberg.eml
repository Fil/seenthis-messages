Post-Christmas Recycling Saves Outdated IPods From Dump - Bloomberg

❝While Green Citizen is trying to offset gadget waste, Kao said that still isn’t a match for a consumer culture that encourages people to seek the latest and greatest technology. About 80 percent of U.S. electronic waste ends up on container ships and then ditched in developing countries, where companies hire workers to extract the core minerals without any environmental or worker-safety oversight, he said.
“It’s going to get worse and worse,” Kao said. “Initially, I tried to fight it, but you can’t.”❞
