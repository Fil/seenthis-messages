American Beverage Association sponsors conference on obesity in minorities? | Marion Nestle
http://www.foodpolitics.com/2012/07/american-beverage-association-sponsors-conference-on-obesity-in-minorities/

❝the third [sponsor] is the American Beverage Association (ABA), the trade association for Coke, Pepsi, and other sugary drinks linked to poor diets and overweight among children and adults.

This is the group that so opposes Mayor Bloomberg’s proposed bad on soft drinks larger than 16 ounces.

(...) the soft drink industry makes no apologies for targeting minorities and considers it “smart marketing.”

(...) The irony: soft drink companies are sponsoring a conference to solve a health problem that their products helped cause in the first place.

Want to take bets on whether any of the speakers suggests cutting down on sodas or “don’t drink your calories”?❞
