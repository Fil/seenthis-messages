#Copyright Greenwashing
http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/infolaw/2012/12/17/copyright-greenwashing/

❝Mickey Mouse is due to fall out of copyright in 2018, and so the industry wants to get a head start on the debates over the next Copyright Term Extension Act. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the contretemps over SOPA and PROTECT IP was the first real instance of Hollywood not getting its way legislatively. There is a generation of digital natives who have been raised on suspicion of Big Content, and they are starting to attain political influence. So, one response to the fight over whether we’ve tuned copyright correctly (to get more movies, books, etc.) is to shift the battleground: treat copyright as an inherent right rather than an instrumental one.❞
