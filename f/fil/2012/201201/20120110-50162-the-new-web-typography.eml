The New #Web #Typography

❝TYPE ON THE WEB IS ABOUT TO CHANGE FOREVER. AGAIN.
As the #font-face rule emerged, it brought with it sweeping changes to the visual landscape of the web. The designer's toolkit grew substantially, but this integration was only partial. Many typefaces were stripped of their most powerful features: things like swashes, alternates and small caps. These details help to make typefaces more useful and expressive. Now, as #OpenType features become accessible in more browsers, this expressive power can raise typography on the web to an even higher level.
