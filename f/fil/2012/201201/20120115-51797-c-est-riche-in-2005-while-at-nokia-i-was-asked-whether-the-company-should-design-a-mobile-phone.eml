c'est riche !

❝In ~2005 while at Nokia I was asked whether the company should design a mobile phone for illiterate consumers – many illiterate people were already buying Nokia’s products that were designed for people who could read and write – and the current experience was recognised as being suboptimal. After a few rounds of design research my answer was that it was better to sell another half a billion phones of the models that were already being sold to literate consumers (with a few subtle but important user interface tweaks) than to develop something fully optimised but new.❞
