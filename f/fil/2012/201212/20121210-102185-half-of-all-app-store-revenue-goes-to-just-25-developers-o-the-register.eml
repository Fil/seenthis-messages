Half of all app store revenue goes to just 25 developers • The Register
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/04/top_25_app_devs_earn_half_of_revenue/

❝#Apple's #App_Store and the #Google_Play_store each claim to offer over 700,000 apps to choose from, but only a tiny fraction of them bring in significant revenue for their developers, according to research from analyst firm Canalys.

In fact, the company says, of the $120m in total revenue generated from paid app downloads and in-app purchases in the US during the first 20 days of November 2012, fully half was split between just 25 developers.❞
