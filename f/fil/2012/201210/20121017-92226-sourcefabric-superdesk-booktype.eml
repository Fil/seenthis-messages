❝Open software for managing newsrooms and their content.
One of the biggest challenges for independent media organisations is finding a publishing system that can deliver to all print, broadcast and digital platforms; the cost for those not tied to big business or political interests is prohibitive. Superdesk is an open source newsroom tool that ensures media organisations are free to define their own type of newsroom organisation, content delivery and business strategy. It has been built by journalists, for journalists, with the aim of helping the media business towards financial sustainability.❞
