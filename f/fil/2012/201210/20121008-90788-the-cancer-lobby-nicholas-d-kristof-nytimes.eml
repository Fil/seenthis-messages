The #Cancer #Lobby - Nicholas D. Kristof / NYTimes

❝Who knew that carcinogens had their own lobby in Washington?
 
Don’t believe me? Just consider formaldehyde, which is found in everything from nail polish to kitchen countertops, fabric softeners to carpets. Largely because of its use in building materials, we breathe formaldehyde fumes when we’re inside our homes.

Just one other fact you should know: According to government scientists, it causes cancer.❞
