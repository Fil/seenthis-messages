Behind Blue Coat: Investigations of commercial filtering in Syria and Burma – The Citizen Lab
http://citizenlab.org/2011/11/behind-blue-coat/

❝Since August 2011, Citizen Lab researchers have been conducting technical research into the presence of Blue Coat devices in Syria and in other countries under the rule of authoritarian regimes. While Blue Coat’s most recent admissions confirm a number of our findings, our research has also raised additional questions relevant to the use of Blue Coat technology for purposes that compromise internationally-recognized human rights. Our findings include the presence of additional Blue Coat devices active in Syria, as well as the presence of a number of Blue Coat devices in Burma.❞
