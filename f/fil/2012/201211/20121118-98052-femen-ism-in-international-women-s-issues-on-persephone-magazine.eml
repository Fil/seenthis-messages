FEMEN-ism in International Women’s Issues on Persephone Magazine.

❝FEMEN gets a lot of attention, fights the stereotype that feminists are man-hating hulks of testosterone-y estrogen, and their performances can be seen as a parody on the status quo. BUT, with no understanding of who is funding the group, as well as the use of a very specific type of topless woman in their protests, it is hard to see the group as anything other than a misogynist’s dream of what feminism is supposed to be.❞
