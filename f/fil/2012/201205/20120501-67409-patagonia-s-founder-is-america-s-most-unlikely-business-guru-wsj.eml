Patagonia's Founder is America's Most Unlikely Business Guru - WSJ
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303513404577352221465986612.html

le modèle alternatif du patron de Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard ; intéressant notamment par la nouvelle possibilité dans le droit californien de l'#entreprise "benefit" qui n'a pas comme exclusive obligation légale de rapporter du fric à ses actionnaires.

❝Chouinard marched into state offices on the morning of January 3, 2012, to make Patagonia the very first company to register as a benefit corporation in California. It remains the most prominent company nationwide to have registered thus far. For Chouinard, the value of this is less about the present than the future. He can do whatever he wants at Patagonia right now, with no threat of shareholders revolting if he sacrifices a bit of profit in the name of menschy communitarianism. He owns the place in full, for as long as he's alive. But he's cagey about succession, and it's clear what he fears: He never wants Patagonia to go public, or to lever itself up in search of rapid growth, as it mistakenly did before. He's convinced that becoming a #benefit_corporation will help prevent that from ever happening.❞
