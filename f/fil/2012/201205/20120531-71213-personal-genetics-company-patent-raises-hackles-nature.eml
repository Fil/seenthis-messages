Personal genetics company patent raises hackles : Nature
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/05/personal-genetics-company-patent-raises-hackles.html

Avec ses #brevets #génétiques 23andme est-elle en train de trahir ses clients ?

❝According to a blog by company’s co-founder Anne Wojcicki, the #patent “relates to our discovery of a variant in the SGK1 gene that may be protective against #Parkinson’s disease in individuals who carry the rare risk-associated LRRK2 G2019S mutation.”
(...) “I had assumed that 23andMe was against patenting genes and felt in total cahoots all along with you guys. If I’d known you might go that route with my data, I’m not sure I would have answered any surveys.”❞
