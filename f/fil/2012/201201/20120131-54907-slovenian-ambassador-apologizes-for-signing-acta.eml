Slovenian Ambassador Apologizes for Signing #ACTA
http://activepolitic.com:82/News/2012-01-31e/Slovenian_Ambassador_Apologizes_for_Signing_ACTA.html

❝The Slovenian Ambassador to Tokyo has issued a public apology for signing ACTA. He claims that he was neglegent and didn't know what he was doing. Rough translation: 

"I signed Acta out of Civil #negligence, because I was not careful enough. I quite simply did not link the agreement to which I was signing, to the authority of the Government. With that agreement, which, I believe restricts freedom of action taken on the biggest and most important network in the history of mankind; and thus imposes limits to future generations of our children.❞

#WTF !
