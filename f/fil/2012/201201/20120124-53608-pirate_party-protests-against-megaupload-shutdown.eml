#Pirate_Party Protests Against Megaupload Shutdown
http://thenextweb.com/eu/2012/01/24/megaupload-shutdown-the-catalan-pirate-party-launches-a-civil-action-against-the-fbi/

❝The Pirate Party’s Catalan branch (PP-Cat) is launching a collective civil action in Spain against the FBI with regard to #Megaupload shutdown, the organization announced yesterday.

The action already branched out on Twitter with the hashtag #megacomplaint. (...)

when Megaupload was shut down, millions of Spanish users potentially lost access to legit personal files they had uploaded. According to the Pirate Party, those may deserve legal recourse against the loss they sustained, as the FBI may have violated Articles 197 and 198 of the Spanish Penal Code by misappropriating #personal #data.❞
