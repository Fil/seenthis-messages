Taliban halts polio vaccinations over drone strikes | Nature

❝#Taliban leaders in #Pakistan are blocking a #polio #vaccination campaign that was to target 161,000 children in North Waziristan.

The Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur is demanding that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) halt #drone strikes, which have heavily targeted the mountainous region, according to a story in the New York Times. The move could prove a setback for the global initiative to eradicate polio, which aims to stop polio transmission globally by the end of 2012 but is unlikely to meet that deadline. (see ‘Polio’s last stand‘)❞
