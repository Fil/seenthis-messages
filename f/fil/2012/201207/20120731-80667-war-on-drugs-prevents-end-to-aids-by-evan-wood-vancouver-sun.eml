War on drugs prevents end to AIDS, by Evan Wood, Vancouver Sun 
http://www.vancouversun.com/health/drugs+prevents+AIDS/7005785/story.html

❝It's clear that aggressive drug law enforcement strategies by governments continue to drive the HIV epidemic
 
Remarkably, the group among the most hard hit by HIV/AIDS is largely absent from the 19th International AIDS Conference. People addicted to intravenous drug use suffer extreme human rights abuses under a myriad of misguided policies in many areas of the world, and are barred entry to the United States. To add further injury, the issue of drug addiction has received scant attention at the conference, especially when compared to the impact it has on driving HIV infection.❞
