More Commercial Drones Flying Now Than Military | TPM Livewire
http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entries/report-more-commercial-drones-flying-now-than-military

❝#Wired magazine editor and chief Chris Anderson writes that his other company, 3D Robotics, estimates it has shipped more commercial #drone parts to customers (10,000) than the U.S. military has flying today (7,494).

Anderson goes on to explain how in 2007 he came to start an online forum for amateur drone ethusiasts and hobbyists that now has 26,000 members, pointing out that the cheap availability of smartphone sensors has led to an explosion in commercial drone development. Anderson doesn’t see this as threatening but rather a revolution akin to that of the personal computer.

What we will do with our personal drones? That question is just as unanswerable—but just as tantalizing—as the same question about personal computers back in 1977.❞
