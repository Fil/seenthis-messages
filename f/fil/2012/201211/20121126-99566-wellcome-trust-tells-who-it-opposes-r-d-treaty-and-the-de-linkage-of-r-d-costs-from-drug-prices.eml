Wellcome Trust tells WHO it opposes R&D Treaty and the de-linkage of R&D costs from drug prices | Knowledge Ecology International

❝It is curious that de-linkage, an over-arching principle that guides the WHO global strategy on public health, innovation and intellectual property is questioned by this British philanthropy in contrast to the Council of the European Union conclusions (2010) which promoted the exploration of models that dissociated the costs of R&D from the prices of medicines.
While the Wellcome Trust is still stuck in the stone age, it should be noted that the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Association and companies such as Novartis have embraced the de-linkage concept for certain situations.❞
