Electric car grants worth £5,000 'benefit the well off' | Mail Online

❝despite the generous subsidies, demand for electric cars remains incredibly low - with only £11 million spent out of a total available pot of £30 million.

Most families still find the cars too expensive even with the grant, MPs said.

Most of those using the subsidies are affluent middle-class families who are using it to buy a second car - meaning the effect on the environment is minimal.❞
