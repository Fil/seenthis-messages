Are we really getting happier?

critique d'un sondage sur le bonheur ; le pire du #data #journalisme, des #statistiques aberrantes, des #sondages à la petite cuiller et des #chiffres au doigt mouillé

❝In April 2007, the first month of the survey, China's "total happiness" was 59%. The next month it rose to 92%. Then it drops back to mid-50s for two months and then for the middle of the survey period it's in the 80s and then drops to the 70s, and is at 78% in November 2011. 
(...)
There seems to be an underlying acceptance that market research doesn't require the same rigorous standards as proper scientific research (...) However, the rules of statistics don't change. More pointedly, the relationship between the numbers and what those numbers can reasonably be interpreted to mean, doesn’t change.

Of course, when you make unwarranted claims in a scientific journal, your peers will embarrass you and show you why you are wrong. If you make far-fetched claims as a market research company, scores of newspapers and websites will report them uncritically.❞
