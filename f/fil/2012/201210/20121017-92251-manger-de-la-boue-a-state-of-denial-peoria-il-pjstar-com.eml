Manger de la boue - A State of Denial - Peoria, IL - pjstar.com

❝In 2007 I posted that people in Soleil were so hungry they were eating mud. 
 
As people found out about this atrocity I think they were in disbelief. One commenter wrote that maybe the lady who makes the mudpies in Soleil should "turn into a Mrs. Fields and export her mudpies to the States". 
 
In 2012 people in Soleil are still eating mudpies. 

(...)

Denial is good for us when it comes to thinking about this. It could not be happening we tell ourselves. This can't be happening 90 minutes from Miami.❞
