Young Scientists Embrace Crowdfunding - NYTimes
http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/young-scientists-embrace-crowdfunding/

❝#Crowdfunding has drawn its share of criticism. Some argue
that it is biased in favor of trendy projects (people are more likely to support polar bear research than cyanobacteria research) and that the projects seeking funds have not been peer-reviewed. (At the National Science Foundation, scientists review the proposals of other scientists to judge the worthiness of their research proposals.)

But in Dr. Skelly’s view, the benefits seem to trump the drawbacks. “For the first time in my career – and I got my Ph.D. 20 years ago – there’s a dialogue going on between scientists doing primary research and the public,” he said.❞
