Netherlands rejects #Acta, and forbids any similar legislation (Wired UK)
http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-05/30/dutch-acta-rejection

❝The Dutch government has decided that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (Acta) is not good for privacy or internet freedom and therefore shouldn't be signed. In doing so, the Netherlands has opted not to wait for the EU's vote on Acta, scheduled for June.

Not only that, however, but Dutch MPs have also ruled that the government will never sign any treaties that are similar to Acta. A motion was passed promising to reject any future treaty that might harm a "free and open" #internet.❞
