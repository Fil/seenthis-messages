❝how big is the problem? Try 100 million young people entering the workforce between now and 2020. In a country with about 600 million citizens under the age of 25, India has a golden opportunity to live up to the projections of becoming the next China. (...)
So what’s a government to do? Put its hope in young, hungry entrepreneurs to build institutes of higher learning using U.S. universities as models.❞
