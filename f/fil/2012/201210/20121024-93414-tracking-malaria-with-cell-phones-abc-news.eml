Tracking Malaria With Cell Phones - ABC News
http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/10/11/tracking-malaria-with-cell-phones/

❝Harvard researchers found they could track the spread of malaria in Kenya using phone calls and text messages from 15 million mobile phones.
“Before mobile phones, we had proxies for human travel, like road networks, census data  and small-scale GPS studies,”  said study author Caroline Buckee, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. “But now that mobile phones have spread throughout the world, we can start using these massive amounts of data to quantify human movements on a larger scale and couple this data with knowledge of infection risk.” (...) By studying networks of human and parasite movement, the team could then determine primary sources of #malaria and who was most likely to become infected.❞
