Russian newswire reports ancient Antarctic lake drilling success | Nature News Blog

❝scientists have successfully drilled into an Antarctic lake that has been sealed off from the world for some 15 million years.

RIA Novosti says the two-decade long project to reach Lake Vostok has finally had its literal breakthrough, crunching through the 3,750-metre thick ice to reach the lake.

“Yesterday, our scientists stopped drilling at the depth of 3,768 meters and reached the surface of the sub-glacial lake,” the source told RIA Novosti.❞
