The ANC must show leadership and reverse patronage and corruption | Thabang Motsohi

❝Post 1994, the ANC was virtually forced to adopt a neo-colonial socio-economic paradigm that was propagated by the World Bank and the IMF. We also adopted its values of selfish individualism and wealth creation. The outcome was never in doubt and we have now achieved the unenviable status of being the most unequal society in the world.

Without doubt there have been great changes in South Africa since the ANC took power in 1994. Millions of poor people have been lifted out of the poverty trap, thanks to welfare support payments. But contemporary South Africa manifests the shortcomings envisaged by Fanon and there is a dark underbelly because the socio-economic situation has worsened for the majority of the poor.❞
