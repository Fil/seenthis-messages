The Global Brain Trade - IEEE Spectrum
http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/the-global-brain-trade

❝Which countries have the most foreign scientists, and which ones suffer from the worst brain drain? To answer these questions, researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research, in Massachusetts, conducted a Web-based survey of over 17 000 published scientists in 16 countries. (China wasn’t surveyed: The researchers tried but were unsuccessful in administering the survey to scientists there.)❞
