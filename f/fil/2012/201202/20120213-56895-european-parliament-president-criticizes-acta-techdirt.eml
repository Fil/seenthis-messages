European Parliament President Criticizes #ACTA | Techdirt
http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120213/00272917738/european-parliament-president-criticizes-acta.shtml

❝European Parliament president Martin Schulz has finally made a statement on the matter saying, "I don't find it good in its current form." This is important, because the key thing that matters in terms of getting ACTA ratified in the EU is how the EU Parliament votes. 

Of course, Schulz's choice of words is unfortunate, because it implies (incorrectly) that ACTA is still in the negotiation process and there may be another "form." That's not the case. This is the final version of the document❞
