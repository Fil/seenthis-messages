How a Global R&D Convention Could Fill the Gaps Left by Today's Medical Innovation System | msfaccess.org

❝our field teams still grapple every day with the fact that the drugs, diagnostics and vaccines needed to treat patients are unavailable, unsuitable or unaffordable.
This is a direct consequence of today’s medical innovation system. Building on a decade-long process of analysis and deliberations, experts at the World Health Organization have now recommended that it is time to change the way medical research and development (R&D) is conducted, in order to address the needs of developing countries. Governments now have an opportunity to support this landmark recommendation and start negotiating a binding convention on biomedical R&D that could fill innovation gaps.❞
