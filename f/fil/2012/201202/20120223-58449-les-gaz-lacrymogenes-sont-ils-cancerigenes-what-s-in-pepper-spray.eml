❝Both PCE and TCE made the list in April 1988 as chemicals that cause #cancer.
Yet no law is on the books in California to prevent PCE's or TCE's use in products meant to be sprayed directly into somebody's face.
"California has banned other uses of TCE in consumer products, including spray paints and other aerosols"❞
