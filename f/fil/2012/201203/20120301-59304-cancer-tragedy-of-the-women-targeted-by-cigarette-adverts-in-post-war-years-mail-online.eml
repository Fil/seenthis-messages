❝Women are paying a deadly price for being targeted by tobacco advertisers in the post-war years, health experts claimed yesterday.

They were responding to research showing that this year more British women will die from lung cancer than any other cancer.

(...) The figures, published today, predict a rising number of cancer deaths across Europe, reaching 1.3million in 2012. This is because a greater number of people are living into old age.❞
