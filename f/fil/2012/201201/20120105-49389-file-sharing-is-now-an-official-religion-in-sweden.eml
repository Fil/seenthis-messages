File sharing is now an official religion in Sweden

❝Yes, file sharing has been officially recognized as a religion by the Swedish government. The Church of Kopimism is the fruit of philosophy student Isak Gerson’s efforts. After two unsuccessful attempts to convince authorities to recognize the religion (its methods of praying or meditiaton were deemed too informal), Kopimism was finally granted religious status.

* copying or remixing information from another person is an act of respect and an expression of faith

Most religions have a formal set of symbols, and Kopimism is no exception. It appropriately uses Control-C and Control-V (keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste) as sacred symbols.❞
