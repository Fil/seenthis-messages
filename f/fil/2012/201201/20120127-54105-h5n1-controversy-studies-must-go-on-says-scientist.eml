#H5N1 controversy: Studies must go on, says scientist
http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2012/01/h5n1-controversy-studies-must-go-on-says-scientist.html

❝Despite declaring last week a 60-day moratorium on the studies to allay security fears, Yoshihiro Kawaoka argued in a commentary in the journal Nature it was urgent and vital that his work continue.  (...)
Last week, the two teams - Kawaoka's and a second team led by Ron Fouchier at Erasmus Medical College in the Netherlands - said they would temporarily suspend their research because of the concerns. 
But writing in Nature on Wednesday, Kawaoka argued it would be "irresponsible" and dangerous not to continue researching highly pathogenic bird flu viruses.❞
