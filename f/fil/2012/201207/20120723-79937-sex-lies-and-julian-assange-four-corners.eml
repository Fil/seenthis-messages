Sex, Lies and Julian Assange - Four Corners
http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2012/07/19/3549280.htm

❝When Julian Assange arrived in Sweden in August 2010 he was greeted like a conquering hero. But within weeks there was a warrant out for his arrest and he was being investigated for rape and sexual molestation. Today he is taking sanctuary in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, arguing he won't receive justice if he's taken to Sweden and that US authorities are building a case for his extradition.❞
