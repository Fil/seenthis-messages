“What’s next, Jailbreaking your Mac?”
http://thenextweb.com/dd/2012/02/16/apples-gatekeeper-pushes-developers-toward-a-mac-app-store-future/

❝#Apple announced an important “Security” feature: Gatekeeper. In Apple’s own words:
Now you can choose from three security options. You can download and run applications from anywhere, just as in OS X Lion. To be even safer, download and run apps from the Mac App Store and apps with a Developer ID. Or download and run only apps from the Mac App Store — the safest setting of all. #Gatekeeper lets you decide which setting is best for you.❞
