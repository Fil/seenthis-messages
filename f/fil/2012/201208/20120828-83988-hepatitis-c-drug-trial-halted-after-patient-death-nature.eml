Hepatitis C drug trial halted after patient death | Nature
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/08/hepatitis-c-drug-trial-halted-after-patient-death.html

❝Bristol-Myers Squibb has halted development of a potential hepatitis C drug after nine participants in a clinical trial of the therapy were hospitalised and one died (see press release).
(...)
Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) acquired the rights to the drug BMS-986094 (formerly known as INX-189) when it bought Inhibitex of Alpharetta, Georgia for US$2.5 billion in January (see ‘Pharma giants buy up hepatitis C hopefuls’).
(...) Abandoning the drug amounts to writing off about $1.8 billion of what BMS paid for Inhibitex. After the news of the safety crisis broke, shares in BMS fell, reducing its market value by billions (see Fierce Biotech).❞
