Former ICANN CEO calls on #hackers to keep the #Internet free from regulation | VentureBeat

❝former ICANN chief executive Rod Beckstrom called for the hacker community to protect the Internet from regulation.

“It’s not merely that everybody should be able to communicate with everybody else at any time, it’s that people actually want to,” said Dan Kamisky at the Def Con conference in Las Vegas. “It’s not just a reconfiguration of government, it’s a reconfiguration of human social behavior.”

WCIT will be a seminal moment for the Internet. There, the International Telecommunications Regulations will be decided — a document that will touch all Internet users whether they know it or not. According to Beckstrom, the Internet needs to be an organized chaos. And to keep the Internet free and open for all, hackers across the world need to start talking to their lawmakers.

“We should not move our nation of the Internet from a multi-stakeholder model, which includes all voices, to a process that only includes one,” said Beckstrom at Def Con.❞
