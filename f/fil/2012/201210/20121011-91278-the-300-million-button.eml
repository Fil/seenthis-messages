The $300 Million Button
http://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button/

❝It's hard to imagine a form that could be simpler: two fields, two buttons, and one link. Yet, it turns out this form was preventing customers from purchasing products from a major e-commerce site, to the tune of $300,000,000 a year. What was even worse: the designers of the site had no clue there was even a problem.❞

@seenthis à ce propos on me fait remarquer que le bouton "Envoyer" du formulaire ne s'affiche pas toujours (Firefox 15)
