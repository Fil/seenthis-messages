précision de #TAC
❝The headline (...) have left you with an optimistic impression if you did not read the remainder of the article. 
Only $7.1m of the over $12m owed to the Round 6 sub-recipients for July to December 2011 (which includes TAC) has been released. Also, as of the time of writing, the money is still not in the TAC bank account. Furthermore, we have not received our tranche for January 2012.❞
