❝Because we were working in mobile Safari on the iPad, we were able to program some cool features into the Web app. But these came with restrictions, such as:
The features would work only in portrait orientation,
The Web app had to be saved to the iPad’s home screen and launch from there,
All links in the Web app would open in a new browser tab.
We also made some other tweaks:
Hid the browser chrome (URL bar and buttons) using <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />;
Created a bookmark icon for the home screen and linked to it using <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/path/to/icon.png" />;
Set the color of the status bar (the options are black, gray or black translucent) using <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black" />;
Made all events touch events, as opposed to hover events, to accommodate the limitations of the touchscreen.❞
