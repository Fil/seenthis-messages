Journals Warned to Keep a Tight Lid on Diesel Exposure Data - ScienceInsider
http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/journals-warned-to-keep-a-tight.html

❝Editors with at least four research publications say they have received a letter advising them against "publication or other distribution" of data and draft documents. The warning, including a vague statement about "consequences" that could ensue if the advice is ignored, is signed by Henry Chajet, an attorney at the Patton Boggs firm in Washington, D.C., and a lobbyist for the Mining Awareness Resource Group, which works on behalf of the mining industry.❞
