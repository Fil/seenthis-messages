de fil en aiguille cette réflexion sur l'#urbanisme et ce que signifie une #ville vivante, et l'idée de calculer ça avec des méthodes de #GIS :

❝Any city that looks too regular or that exists only on the large scale must be treated with suspicion: it may be alive, but there are primary reasons to warrant checking if human activity and movement are indeed taking place on all scales. A living geometry encourages movement and the utilization of space (not to be confused with people putting up with a hostile geometry because they have no other choice). If that is not happening, then the city is dead. Although hundreds of millions of persons have been forced to live in dead urban regions, that does not make those places any more alive in an essential sense. Those dead regions actually look very neat and ordered from the air.❞

❝American suburbanites accepted the burden of buying and maintaining a front lawn that they themselves never use, and which is meant strictly for the visual promotion of the suburban icon for private development companies. The front lawn is a fiercely private realm that cannot be used by others. As a result, no one uses this wasted space on any regular basis. In Europe, the same wasteful philosophy, replacing natural connections by formal, visual typologies, has led to the useless garden. Bearing no relation to older gardens that give pleasure to pedestrians, we see in Europe pieces of green that are inaccessible, isolated, and usually constrained by an unnatural formalistic geometry (both in their overall shape, and in the shape of their physical built supports such as planters).❞
