Roche Propels Cancer Drug Sales in China With Insurance - Bloomberg
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-13/roche-propels-cancer-drug-sales-in-china-with-insurance.html

❝Roche Holding AG (ROG) has found a way to sell cancer drugs to millions in China who couldn’t otherwise afford them: first sell them insurance.
The world’s biggest maker of tumor medicines is getting together with reinsurer Swiss Re to sell a Swiss-engineered private insurance that’s on track to garner 10 million clients this year, says Harald Sprenger, Roche’s director of private insurance and market-access strategy in China. Both partners expect a 20 percent enrollment jump next year.❞
