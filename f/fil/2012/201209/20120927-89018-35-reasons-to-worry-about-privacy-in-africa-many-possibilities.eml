35 Reasons to Worry About #Privacy in #Africa | Many Possibilities

❝Over the last five years there has been a steady trend for African governments to implement mandatory SIM card registration policies.  This means that you can’t buy a SIM card for a mobile phone without producing an ID document and proof of address.  South Africa was one of the first African countries to do this but many have followed including Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and many others.  At last count, no less than 35 African countries (see list below) have implemented obligatory #SIM card registration.❞
