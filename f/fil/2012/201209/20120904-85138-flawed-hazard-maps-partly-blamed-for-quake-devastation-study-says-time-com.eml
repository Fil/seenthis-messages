Flawed Hazard Maps Partly Blamed for Quake Devastation, Study Says | TIME.com
http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/09/03/earthquake-damage-are-bad-maps-to-blame/

❝the maps can be oversimplified, largely because the mapmakers don’t have enough data about earthquake history in their areas of interest. As such, the study says, they often work off their own preconceptions — and the maps don’t do too well when those assumptions are wrong.

(...) The researchers who conducted the Tectonophysics study propose two changes to current mapping approaches: communicating the uncertainties of each map to users and checking each map against a reference map. Perhaps most important, however, is the authors’ recommendation that mapmakers approach their jobs with a “sense of humility and caution.”❞
