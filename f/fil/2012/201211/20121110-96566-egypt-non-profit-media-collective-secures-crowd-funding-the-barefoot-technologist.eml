Egypt: Non–profit media collective secures crowd–funding | The Barefoot Technologist

❝Mosireen, a non–profit media collective in Downtown Cairo “born out of the explosion of citizen media and cultural activism in Egypt during the revolution” has used the crowd–funding platform IndieGoGo to secure $40,000 of funding from over 350 donors. The sum is a significant contribution to its $60,000/year running costs for providing workspaces, editing facilities and screenings for independent media producers. The money raised will be supplemented by membership fees from service users, collected on a pay–what–you–can basis.❞

❝Tahrir Cinema is an open-air screening of revolutionary footage that takes place in Tahrir Square, presenting the products of Egyptian citizen journalism as filmed in protests, strikes and sit-ins. The footage shown at Tahrir cinema represents an alternative media that is open for everyone to film, produce and interact with.❞
