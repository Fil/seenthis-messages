Enemy Mine | 1985
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_Mine_(film)

❝Enemy Mine is a 1985 science fiction #film based on the story of the same title by Barry B. Longyear. It was produced by 20th Century Fox, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, and starred Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. The whole film was originally shot in Vestmannaeyjar in Iceland, but original director Richard Loncraine and the producers ran into "creative differences", and the project was shut down. Wolfgang Petersen took over direction and reshot the whole film, with the production moving to Munich.
Beset by production problems, including a change of director, that caused its budget to spiral out of control, it was a critical and financial disappointment.❞
