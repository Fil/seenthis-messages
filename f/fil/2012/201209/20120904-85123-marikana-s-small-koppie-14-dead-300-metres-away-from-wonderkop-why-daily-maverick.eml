Marikana's Small Koppie: 14 dead, 300 metres away from Wonderkop. Why? - Daily Maverick

❝Since the publication of the article positing that police had murdered some of the miners at the Small Koppie, individuals close to various arms of the investigation have approached us, verifying the main thrust of the argument. We can now confirm the frightening details: 14 dead at the Small Koppie, 300 metres away from the better known massacre, minutes after the much-televised stampede. Yes, we were disturbed, too. By GREG MARINOVICH.❞
