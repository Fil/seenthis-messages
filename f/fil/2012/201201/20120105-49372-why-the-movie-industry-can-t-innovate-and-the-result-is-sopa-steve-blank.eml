❝The U.S. State Department has been championing the Internet Freedom initiative across the world. Secretary of State Clinton said, “…when ideas are blocked, information deleted, conversations stifled, and people constrained in their choices, the Internet is diminished for all of us.”
It’s too bad the head of the #MPAA – an ex Senator - made a mockery of her words when he wondered “why our online censorship can’t be like China?”
We wonder, “Why can’t the film industry innovate like Silicon Valley?”❞
