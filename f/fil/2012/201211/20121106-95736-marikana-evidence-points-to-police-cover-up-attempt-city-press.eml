❝A police video shot during the day and photographs taken at around the same time at scene two, known as Klein Koppie, show bloodied bodies lying without any weapons next to them.

However, in photographs taken by forensic crime expert Captain Apollo Jeremiah Mohlaki after sunset, the pictures of the same bodies appear with a myriad of traditional weapons next to them.❞
