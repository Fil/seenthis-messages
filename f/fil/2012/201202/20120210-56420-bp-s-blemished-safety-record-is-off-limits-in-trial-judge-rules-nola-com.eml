BP's blemished safety record is off-limits in trial, judge rules | NOLA.com
http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2012/02/judge_rules_bps_blemished_safe.html

❝Plaintiffs in the lawsuit against #BP over damages from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill won't be allowed to bring up the oil giant's spotty past safety record, including a major accident in Texas City, Texas, nor will they be allowed to use the contents of a series of reports on the causes of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ruled Thursday.❞

c'est quand même beau la #justice #environnementale aux #etats-unis
