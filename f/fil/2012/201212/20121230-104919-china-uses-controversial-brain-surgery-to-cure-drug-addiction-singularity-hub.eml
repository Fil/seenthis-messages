China Uses Controversial Brain Surgery To Cure Drug Addiction | Singularity Hub
http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/30/chinas-uses-controversial-brain-surgery-to-cure-drug-addiction/

❝A small handful of doctors in China are going to extremes to rid people of addiction. As a last resort against intractable addiction to heroine and alcohol, these doctors are attempting to erase motivation by erasing a part of the addict’s brain. And they are doing it in the face of worldwide condemnation, and in the name of scientific research.

The procedure involves drilling small holes into the skulls of patients and inserting long electrodes which extend down to the part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. This area, often referred to as the “pleasure center” of the brain, is the major nucleus of the brain’s reward circuit.❞
