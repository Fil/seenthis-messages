The Truth About the Doomsday Virus? - NYTimes
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/opinion/sunday/the-truth-about-the-doomsday-virus.html?_r=1

❝[Ron Fouchier] says that the virus did not spread easily and was not lethal when transmitted from one ferret to another by coughing or sneezing, and that it became highly lethal only when big doses were injected into the animals’ windpipes.

Dr. Fouchier’s new claims are only the latest bizarre twist in a global health debate that badly needs an objective, independent arbiter. The public needs to know whether this virus is a potentially big killer, and if so, how it should be contained❞
