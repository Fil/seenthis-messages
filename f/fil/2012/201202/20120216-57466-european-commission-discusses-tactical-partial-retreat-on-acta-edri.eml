European Commission discusses tactical, partial retreat on #ACTA | EDRI
http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.3/ec-discusses-partial-acta-retreat

nos dirigeants européens vont magouiller un peu pour faire passer l'acta en douce, plus tard, quand on aura oublié… pourtant anonymous a prévenu : we will not forget etc.

❝a referral of ACTA to the Court of Justice of the European Union is currently being considered.
The minutes of the meeting, which have been obtained by EDRi, say that the head of cabinet described the "strong mobilisation" against the Agreement by "certain NGOs and movements active on the Internet" and stated that a referral of the Agreement to the Court of Justice is being considered. It is noteworthy that the suggestion is only to check the compatibility of ACTA with primary EU law. Such a referral, depending on how it is framed, risks being quite vague and may not lead to a comprehensive response. However, any broadly favourable response from the Court would most certainly be used to push through the Agreement, on the basis that the ruling "proves" that there is no problem.❞
