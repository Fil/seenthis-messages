❝Makers are a breed of super-hobbyists who have been coalescing into a social movement around technologies like 3-D printing. Because of the availability of crowdfunding, their projects are becoming more ambitious, and some are turning into companies. One project called Ninja Blocks—the invention is a rubbery block of sensors that uploads reports to the Internet—raised $102,000 on Kickstarter, generating attention that allowed its creators pull in another $1 million from investors.❞
 
❝bars, bakeries, and technologies that are fun or solve social problems are likely to be popular categories.❞
 
❝Much of the money may flow to what are known as "user innovators"—people who invent products they need or want, initially for their own use. (...) A study by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation released in February estimated that 47 percent of startups pursuing innovative products had been created by people who fit this profile
"A lot of breakthroughs are created by product users, not in centralized R&D labs. And #crowdfunding will be a new way to pay for that❞
