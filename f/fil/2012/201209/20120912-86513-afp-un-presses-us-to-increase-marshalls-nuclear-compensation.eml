AFP: UN presses US to increase Marshalls nuclear compensation
http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5inGg_fWvtnYwDef9ZAXwQ2VS08mg

❝The United States needs to provide extra compensation to settle claims by nuclear-affected Marshall islanders and end a "legacy of distrust", according to a UN report released Tuesday.
The 19-page report prepared by UN Special Rapporteur Calin Georgescu also urged Washington to declassify secret reports on its nuclear testing programme in the Marshall Islands.
The United States conducted 67 nuclear weapons tests at Bikini and Enewetak atolls from 1946 to 1958.❞
