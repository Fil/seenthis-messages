Report: 900 million mobile connections are held by 300 million people in India

attention aux chiffres sur la #téléphonie #mobile dans les pays où les gens ont 3 ou 4 cartes SIM...

❝In India, the percentage of rural mobile penetration is 39%, and approximately half a billion people in the country’s rural areas are unconnected to mobile networks.

Of 3.2 billion people, 46% of the world’s total population of 7 billion, have at least one active mobile device. That translates to an average of 1.85 SIM cards per user (link). In India there are 900 million mobile connections, however these are in the hands of just 300 million people. In developing markets like India SIM per user patterns are influenced by cost-conscious, low-usage consumers who tend to accumulate prepaid SIM cards depending on the latest and most affordable prepaid tariffs.❞
