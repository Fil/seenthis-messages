Embattled scientists publish study linking (surprise) diesel exhaust and #cancer - Nature News Blog
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/03/embattled-scientists-publish-miner-cancer-study.html


❝the study is more comprehensive and apparently robust than those that have come before, and it comes as at least one major scientific organization prepares to reassess the link between diesel exhaust and cancer. Perhaps it was the fear of this exact scenario that led a coalition of industrial interests to wage a seventeen-year legal and political battle against government scientists conducting the study – a battle that now appears to have outlived its purpose thanks to a 29 February ruling from the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.❞
