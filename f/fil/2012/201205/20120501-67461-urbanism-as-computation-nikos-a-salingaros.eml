Urbanism as computation | Nikos A. Salingaros
http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/urbanism-computation.pdf

❝Five laws of human-scale urbanism. 

1. What appears to work and connect on paper in an abstract, formalistic manner does not necessarily work and connect on the ground. 
2. Adapted computed solutions are not transferable.
3.  Genuinely adaptive computation is based on complex urban algorithms, not  algorithms for generating visual graphic effects.
4.  Adaptive computations generate complex urban fabric with sufficient geometric diversity to not need any imposition of randomness.
5. By destroying its computational coherence, even minor built elements, if they are products of non-interactive algorithms, can switch urban morphology from being adaptive to non-adaptive.❞
