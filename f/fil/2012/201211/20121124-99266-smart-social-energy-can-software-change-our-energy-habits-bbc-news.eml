Smart, social energy: Can software change our energy habits? | BBC News
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20173641

❝software to help people cut their energy use without having to spend too much time working out how to do it.

Firms including British Gas already offer software allowing consumers to monitor and control their central heating from afar.

The intention is to take this to the next level with a system that can analyse the energy use of every device in a home and suggest ways to use them more efficiently - or simply to replace them with better, cheaper-to-run equipment.❞
