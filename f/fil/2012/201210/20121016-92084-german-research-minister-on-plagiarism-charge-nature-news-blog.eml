ça ça va plaire à @reka

❝A confidential report of evaluaters examining the PhD thesis of Annette Schavan, German’s research and education minister, has apparently confirmed charges of plagiarism. Copies of the 75-page report were leaked to the press on 12 October.

According to accounts in the Süddeutsche Zeitung and Der Spiegel, the evaluators’ report claims that Schavan had intended to deceive in her 1980 thesis, on aspects of education, by paraphrasing the work of others without appropriate citation and passing it off as her own.❞
