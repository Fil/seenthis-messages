The New Totalitarianism of #Surveillance Technology, by Naomi Wolf
http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/298-185/12956-focus-the-new-totalitarianism-of-surveillance-technology

❝A software engineer in my Facebook community wrote recently about his outrage that when he visited Disneyland, and went on a ride, the theme park offered him the photo of himself and his girlfriend to buy - with his credit card information already linked to it. (...) the system had to be using facial recognition technology (...) Disney sites are indeed controlled by face-recognition technology, that the military is interested in the technology, and that the face-recognition contractor, Identix, has contracts with the US government - for technology that identifies individuals in a crowd.

(...) bizarre camera/lights had been installed not only all around Union Square but also around Washington Square Park. I posted a photo I took of them, and asked: "What is this?" Commentators who had lived in China said that they were the same camera/streetlight combinations that are mounted around public places in China. These are enabled for facial recognition technology❞
