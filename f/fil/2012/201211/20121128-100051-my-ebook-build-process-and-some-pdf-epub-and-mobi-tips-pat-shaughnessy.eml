My eBook build process and some #PDF, #EPUB and #MOBI tips - Pat Shaughnessy
http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/11/27/my-ebook-build-process-and-some-pdf-epub-and-mobi-tips

plein de conseils techniques pour faire des #ebooks — et cette conclusion :

❝producing an eBook myself was far more tedious and difficult than I had ever thought it would be. I can imagine that partnering with a publishing company would make this all a lot easier – probably you would be able to work within an established, proven technical publishing pipeline. But one of the joys of self-publishing is being able to have full control over the final product❞
