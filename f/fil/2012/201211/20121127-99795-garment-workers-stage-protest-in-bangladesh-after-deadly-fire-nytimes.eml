Garment Workers Stage Protest in Bangladesh After Deadly Fire - NYTimes
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/world/asia/garment-workers-stage-protest-in-bangladesh-after-deadly-fire.html?ref=business&_r=0

au #bangladesh les travailleurs du #textile se révoltent contre l'absence de sécurité dans les usines, et la première ministre met en garde contre… les sabotages et les activités subversives.

❝Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina offered prayers and sympathy for the families of the dead as her cabinet declared that Tuesday would be a day of national mourning. At the same time, she voiced suspicions that the fires were arsons intended to undermine the country’s garment industry. Without presenting any evidence of a broader conspiracy, she called for vigilance against sabotage.

The prime minister on Monday issued a call in Parliament to detain those who were “carrying out subversive activities” and to “take necessary actions against the culprits,” according to BSS, a state-owned news agency.❞
