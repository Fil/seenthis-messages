❝Because Facebook is constantly changing these visibility rules and settings, it makes groups that are overly reliant on these private platforms more subject to their changing rules. (...) For social media companies to make more money, they are taking more control of their systems.

Ultimately, you can’t decide what to see, Facebook does, and now that many groups have migrated to Facebook for what listservs and Web sites have historically done, they now have to pay for that engagement. It’s classic bait and switch.❞
