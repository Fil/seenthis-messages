❝Speaking about the experience, Jake said, “With sites like Pinterest or Tumblr, stuff gets a lot of attention, but nothing really comes of it. With Fancy, it went from an image to a real business.”
Fancy would prefer to think of itself as a competitor to Amazon rather than Pinterest. While users can ‘collect’ and share products and services, just like on Pinterest, Fancy is a marketplace unto itself, enabling the purchase of just about anything from clothes and tickets, to booking hotel rooms.❞
