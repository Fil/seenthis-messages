#Haiti: Playing with #cholera numbers

❝Can't somebody in Haiti tell us what the cholera numbers really are, at least within an order of magnitude? Has PAHO completely abandoned the country since late January? Are the NGOs all gone in search of fresh disasters? Some pretty good journalists are working in Haiti, but they've fallen silent too.

Do we really have to rely on a retired teacher of business communications in surburban Vancouver, BC, to try to keep track of the worst cholera outbreak in the world?❞
