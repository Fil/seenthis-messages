SJC Statement on Marikana Tragedy « Social Justice Coalition
http://www.sjc.org.za/posts/sjc-statement-on-marikana-tragedy

❝The full extent and sequence of events that led to this tragedy are still unclear.  It is however apparent that a severe vacuum in leadership led to the escalation of a potentially dangerous situation which had been brewing for months.  It also appears likely that SAPS made several errors which culminated in a volatile situation in which heavily armed police officers engaged strikers with disproportionate and excessive force, for which there can be no excuse.

The SJC notes President Jacob Zuma’s announcement to establish a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the incident.  To be effective, such an inquiry must investigate events leading up to and including the tragedy – including the roles played by SAPS, Lonmin Platinum, Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), government ministers (including but not limited to Police, Mines and Labour), and other involved parties.❞
