Should we fear avian H5N1 influenza?
http://www.virology.ws/2012/01/03/should-we-fear-avian-h5n1-influenza/

❝we cannot say with any certainty that the virus has infected only about 600 people. What we do know is that among the 600 seriously ill individuals infected with influenza H5N1 who are admitted to hospital, over half of them die.

To know the fatality rate of avian H5N1 influenza virus in humans, we need to divide the number of fatalities by the number of infections. We do not know that last number – but there are hints that it could be quite large. (...)

down a dangerous path of fearing that H5N1 influenza virus might be used as a weapon of #bioterrorism, and restricting the publication of scientific papers on the virus.❞
