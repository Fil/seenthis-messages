Piwik Security Bug Bounty Program
http://piwik.org/security/

❝The Piwik Security Bug Bounty Program is designed to encourage security research in Piwik and to reward those who help us create the safest web analytics platform.

The bounty for valid critical security bugs is a $500 (US) cash reward. The bounty for non-critical bugs is $200 (US), paid via Paypal.
(...)
As of January 2012, we have already rewarded more than 10 researchers. This program has been very successful in improving code quality and fixing all known security issues in Piwik.❞
