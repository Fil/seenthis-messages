EU: Commission wants drones flying in European skies by 2016 | Statewatch
http://www.statewatch.org/news/2012/sep/eu-com-drones.htm

❝It is "imperative for the EU to take action now" to ensure that #drones can fly in civil airspace alongside manned aircraft by 2016, according to a working paper recently released by the European Commission. [1] A raft of measures are suggested that will allow state authorities and private enterprises to fly drones with ease, in order to ensure that European industry gets a slice of the profits from the emerging global market for unmanned aircraft, and to secure "important benefits to European citizens and the European economy as a whole." But despite brief mention of the ethical and political concerns raised by widespread domestic drone usage, the document largely treats the issue as a technical exercise.❞
