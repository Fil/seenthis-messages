Californians #vote down cancer research fund — or did they? : Nature

❝Proposition 29, a ballot measure that would add a $1.00 tax to each pack of #cigarettes sold in California, was put before voters on 5 June, during the state’s Presidential primary election. If approved, the new tax would generate $735 million by 2013-14 for cancer research, smoking prevention and smoking cessation. $441 million of the money would fund grants and loans into “prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and potential cures for cancer and tobacco-related diseases.” An additional $110 million would fund new research facilities.

Groups funded by the #tobacco industry raised $46.8 million to oppose the measure — nearly four times the amount of money raised in favor of the measure, which was supported by #cancer research organizations and billionaires including New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.❞
