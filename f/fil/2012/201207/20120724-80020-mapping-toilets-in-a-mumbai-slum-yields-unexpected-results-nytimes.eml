Mapping Toilets in a Mumbai Slum Yields Unexpected Results - NYTimes
http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/mapping-toilets-in-a-mumbai-slum-yields-unexpected-results/

❝Mr. Potter and his colleagues decided to create a map of Cheeta Camp’s toilets (the interactive map can be found here). That meant two weeks tromping around the slum, figuring out where the toilets were located, who had put them up, how they functioned, and if they were even operational.

The students saw toilets as a way to delve into the inner workings of the community, to see what worked and what did not.  Of course, toilets are more than just a proxy. They are about as fundamental as you can get.❞
