❝A SCOTTISH veteran of 1950s nuclear tests has won a legal victory to force the Ministry of Defence to release radiation exposure records.

David Whyte witnessed five nuclear blasts in the Pacific and says the radiation robbed him of the chance of ever starting a family.

(...) he was told for years by the MoD that they did not have information on the radiation levels he was exposed to when he served in the army on Christmas Island.❞
