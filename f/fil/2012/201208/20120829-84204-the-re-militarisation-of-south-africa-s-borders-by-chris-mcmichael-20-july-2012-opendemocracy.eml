The re-militarisation of South Africa’s borders, by Chris McMichael, 20 July 2012 | openDemocracy

❝Heightened border security has been enforced during international summits and sporting tournaments. This idea of permanent, non-conventional threat provides a legitimation for an extensive increase of defence spending and resources, eagerly cheerled by the private sector. 
(...) [South Africa] has 4, 471 km of land borders, an air border of 7,660 km and one of the longest continuous coastlines in Africa, stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. National government has also tabled a claim with the United Nations for the extension of the county’s maritime territory which, if successful, would increase the area of state authority to over 4,340,000 km2 of water.  South Africa’s land borders overlap with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho and much of this covers mountainous and bushy stretches of terrain which are difficult to comprehensively monitor.  Along with the millions of legal crossings which occur every year, this mix of size and topography provides coverage for illicit migration, smuggling, stock theft and poaching. In addition, the illegal transnational trade in rhino horn has gained a substantial deal of recent attention with heavily armed and organised poachers targeting game parks.❞
