BBC Tracks Down And Confronts An #Internet #Troll | Techdirt

❝ome folks at the BBC apparently were able to track down and confront an individual who had a reputation for highly obnoxious trolling -- writing mean messages on Facebook tribute pages for people who were murdered. I'm not a huge fan of "confrontation" journalism, which feels pretty manufactured, but there is something amusing about watching the guy try to ignore the issue for a while, before realizing he can't resist and he has to respond. It's kind of a form of reverse trolling❞
