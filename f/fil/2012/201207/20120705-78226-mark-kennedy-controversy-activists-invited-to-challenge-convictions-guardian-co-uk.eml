Mark Kennedy controversy: activists invited to challenge convictions | guardian.co.uk
http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/03/mark-kennedy-activists-challenge-convictions

❝Keir Starmer QC said he had invited 29 activists to challenge their convictions at the court of appeal after concluding that a senior prosecutor may have withheld vital evidence about Kennedy from their trial. He also announced a Scotland Yard review all of the police officer's deployments, saying: "What happened in cases involving Mark Kennedy cannot be allowed to happen again."

The campaigners stopped a train carrying about 1,000 tonnes of coal to the Drax power station in North Yorkshire in 2008. Kennedy is understood to have infiltrated the group, assisting them with a reconnaissance mission and later driving some campaigners to a rendezvous. They were convicted in 2009.❞
