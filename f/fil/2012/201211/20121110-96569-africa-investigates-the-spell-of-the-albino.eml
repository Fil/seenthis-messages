❝“The Battle for Souls” is an inside story of how many of the more than 100 000 albinos in Tanzania live in fear of being killed for their body parts, which are believed by some to have mystical and healing powers. While the world was struggling to tame the impact of the global economic crisis, Tanzania was the scene of some of the most atrocious crimes. Local traders planned and executed the killings of albinos to get a hold of their organs in order to boost business. Richard Mgamba, who is based in Dar es Salaam, began his journalism career in 1998, covering stories about Tanzania’s mining, fishing and cotton sectors, as well as arms smuggling in the Great Lakes region. In 2007 he became chief editor of The Citizen and The Sunday Citizen, the most widely-read English-language newspaper in his country.❞
