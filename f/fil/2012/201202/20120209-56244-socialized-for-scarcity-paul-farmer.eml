“socialized for scarcity” - Paul Farmer
http://www.pih.org/news/entry/pih-co-founder-dr.-paul-farmer-reflects-on-haitis-progress-two-years-after-/

❝we are all—the poor and those who serve them—socialized for scarcity. Some part of our brain assumes that if Mirebalais gets the lion’s share of attention—if it actually becomes a flagship project—then some other effort (Cerca Lasource, say, or Cange or Saint-Marc) must suffer. The same holds for elevating Butaro Hospital in Rwanda or the Tomsk prison in Siberia or one teaching hospital over another, or Malawi projects versus those in Lesotho.

But in our best moments, all of us know that this sort of thinking is wrong-headed.  (...)

every care provider—nurse or doctor or social worker or community health provider—working on the frontlines of global health knows full well that the great majority of our patients’ clinical problems are directly linked to poverty. Hence PIH-affiliated projects like “A Thousand Jobs for Haiti” (...) Hence scholarly work in Rwanda to try to document collateral benefits that investments in health and education provide for economic development. Hence our peculiar obsession with the efflorescence of hotels, small businesses, beauty shops, and other small enterprises around PIH-affiliated hospitals.❞
