#Copyright and the internet: Letting the baby dance | The Economist
http://www.economist.com/node/21561885

❝Canada passed a law in June that sets a new standard of permissiveness. It caps statutory damages if copyright is breached for non-commercial purposes. It expands the definition of “fair dealing” (“fair use” in America) and creates exemptions for educational purposes and for parody. Firms must pass warnings about infringement to the person who posted the material rather than immediately take the content down themselves. This contrasts with practice in America [US!] and Europe, where a web company alerted to infringing material must remove it. This encourages knee-jerk responses to complaints.❞
