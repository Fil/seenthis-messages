Dutch proposal to search and destroy foreign computers | EDRI
http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.20/dutch-proposal-state-spyware

❝On 15 October 2012, the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security proposed powers for the police to break into computers, install spyware, search computers and destroy data. These powers would extend to computers located outside the Netherlands. EDRi member Bits of Freedom warns for the unacceptable risks to cybersecurity and calls on other countries to strongly oppose the proposal.
(...)
If the location of the computer cannot be determined, for example in the case of Tor-hidden services, the police is not required to submit a request for legal assistance to another country before breaking in.❞
