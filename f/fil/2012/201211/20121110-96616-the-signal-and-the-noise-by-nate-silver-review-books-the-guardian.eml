The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver – review | Books | The Guardian
http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/nov/09/signal-and-noise-nate-silver-review?CMP=twt_gu

❝Across a wide range of subjects about which people make professional predictions – the housing market, the stock market, elections, baseball, the weather, earthquakes, terrorist attacks – Silver argues for a sharper recognition of "the difference between what we know and what we think we know" and recommends a strategy for closing the gap.❞
