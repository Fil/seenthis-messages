When the mountain meets its shadow (trailer)
http://vimeo.com/46868270

❝Cape Town, South Africa
In hardly any other city of the world can poverty and wealth be found as close together. When The Mountain Meets Its Shadow tells the stories of Ashraf, Mne, Zoliswa and Arnold, who, each in their own way, fight for survival in the informal settlements around Cape Town. While Ashraf and his friend Mne from the Anti Eviction Campaign fight against evictions and water cut-offs in the townships, Zoliswa, a single mother, is looking for a new position as a cleaner and Arnold trains as an armed guard to work in the booming security industry.❞
