#Malaria programme gets kiss of death from #Global_Fund : Nature

❝The Global Fund’s press release detailing its plans is entitled “Board Approves Integration of AMF-m into Core Global Fund Grant Processes“, and much of its soothingly reassuring content would perhaps have many thinking that the AMF-m’s integration into the Global Fund’s core grants system is good news. But it is in effect being killed. There’s will be no new money ringfenced for the AMF-m once it runs through it’s current funding up to the end of 2013, which means that any countries wanting to set aside cash for the private sector will be required to take this from their country grants from the Global Fund. In reality, that will likely translate into AMF-m activities simply being terminated in most countries, leading to local price rises in ACTs, and the drugs disappearing off the shelves of local pharmacies. AMF-m’s clout in negotiating bulk pricing deals internationally will also likely be weakened.❞
