❝As a matter of fact, projects like #Drupal have adopted (for the upcoming version 8) the #HttpFoundation component; if it works for them, it will probably work for you. Don't reinvent the wheel.

I've almost forgot to talk about one added benefit: using the HttpFoundation component is the start of better interoperability between all frameworks and applications using it (as of today Symfony2, Drupal 8, phpBB 4, Silex, Midgard CMS, Zikula, ...).❞

et #SPIP utilise le #YAML de symfony
