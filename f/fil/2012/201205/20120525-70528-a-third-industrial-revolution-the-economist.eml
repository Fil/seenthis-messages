A third industrial revolution | The Economist
http://www.economist.com/node/21552901

❝As manufacturing goes digital, a third great change is now gathering pace. It will allow things to be made economically in much smaller numbers, more flexibly and with a much lower input of labour, thanks to new materials, completely new processes such as 3D printing, easy-to-use robots and new collaborative manufacturing services available online. The wheel is almost coming full circle, turning away from mass manufacturing and towards much more individualised production.❞

ouais ouais… c'est pas vraiment ce qui se passe avec les iPad hein…
