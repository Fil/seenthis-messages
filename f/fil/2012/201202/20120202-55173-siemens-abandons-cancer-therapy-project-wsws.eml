Siemens abandons cancer therapy project | WSWS
http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/feb2012/siem-f02.shtml

❝The construction of the #cancer treatment centre in Kiel was begun in August 2008 and is nearing completion. The plan was to use the new precision methods of particle therapy in the Kiel centre to treat tumors in 3,000 patients per year, attracting patients from northern Germany and the Scandinavian countries.
It has since been found, however, that the large-scale facility can only treat 1,000 patients per year, and not 3,000. With this number of patients, the operation of the facility is not economically viable for the consortium of bidders including Siemens, Bilfinger Berger and HSG Technical Service, which had set up the particle therapy center as a public private partnership project with an investment of €250 million.
(...)
Before pulling out of the facility in Kiel, Siemens had already withdrawn from a project in July 2011 for a similar particle therapy facility in Marburg.
