My Childhood as an Adult Molester: A Salt River Moffie | Zackie Achmat

❝1976 changed my life forever. In the next few years, I became a political activist and was detained several times. Family-life became intolerable. I left home and lived on the streets and with friends. Later I met Daniel, who became my lover for almost ten years. In those years I discovered that sex is political and that, as moffies and letties, we had to be part of a #revolution to change everything. It was the beginning of a life of sex and #politics❞
