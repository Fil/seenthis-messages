❝Researchers at UCT are optimistic they have found a drug that can cure all strains of malaria with a single oral dose.

Some scientists have called the breakthrough drug discovery a gift to Africa, where malaria kills a million people every year.❞

❝In September 2010, a compound code named MMV390048, which subsequently displayed exceptional potency against the parasite, was first designed and made. The compound is stable, and showed significant promise in an in vitro experiment. It was tested in animals in early 2011. The resultant data was even more encouraging as MMV390048 displayed a complete cure of animals infected with malaria parasites when given orally (by mouth) at a low (20 mg/kg) dose. More importantly, the drug remained in the animal for a long time – preventing any potential regrowth of the parasite.❞
