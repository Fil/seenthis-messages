Teen Hacker Banned From The Internet For Six Years | Techdirt
http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121109/16132820999/teen-hacker-banned-internet-six-years.shtml

❝A teenaged hacker known as Cosmo the God, who was involved in a number of big site takedowns earlier this year, and who is considered a "social engineering mastermind" has been sentenced to probation. The terms include a ban on internet access until his 21st birthday, six years from now (...) The #internet is so integrated into our lives these days that taking the internet out of your life is a lot more complicated than some might imagine.❞
