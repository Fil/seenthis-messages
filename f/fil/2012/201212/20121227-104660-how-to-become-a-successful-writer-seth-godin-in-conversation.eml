❝The first four thousand readers are the hard part. I had already done the hard part, and I hadn’t even written the book yet!
Many writers would say, ‘I can’t get that many people to trust me.’ And I would say, ‘Exactly. The reason you can’t is you haven’t been giving stuff away every day for seven years like I have. You haven’t been building a tribe one reader at a time like I have. The best time to start that was seven years ago. The second best time is right now. So start!’
As you build this following for your short stories or your cartoons or your non-fiction or your blog posts, over time you will reach the point where you can organize them and say to them, ‘All right, now I’m going to do something that’s going to take some money, but here’s my promise to you.’ I did that in June, which meant I was able to spend the whole summer writing, not for unknown readers, but for the readers I already knew, which is a really fantastic shift.

(...) I wonder why anyone would hesitate to be generous with their writing.
I mean, if you really want to make a living, go on Wall Street and trade oil futures and rip people off, right? We’re writers. We’re doing something that is inherently a generous act.❞
