❝It’s hard to argue with a million person strong cube-destroying frenzy. 22Cans seems to have surprised even their own expectations as to how well they could manipulate the absurdity of crowd behavior.

In my view, the cube tells us something either incredibly deep or incredibly shallow about our fellow humans. Or, let’s get zen, both deep and shallow at the same time.

Humans are curious, competitive, creative, and destructive. Nothing we don’t already know. But most of all? Humans have a lot of free time these days.❞
