Top 40 Platforms for Crowdfunding Social Change | P2P Foundation

❝Aside from the cool art projects and funky products we’re all familiar with, can #crowdfunding be used to fund positive social change too? It sure can.  As you’ll soon see, with the Top 40 Platforms for Crowdfunding Social Change listed below it is now easier than ever to crowdfund social change.  But people have been successfully pooling resources to meet shared goals and needs for a long time.

An example of particular interest to P2P Foundation readers might be the story of how Jonas Salk created the very first #polio vaccine in the 1950s; it is was crowdfunded and #patent-free.  Salk’s research “was not funded by private foundations or pharmaceutical companies, but by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, a public effort, financed by the donations of millions of ordinary Americans who were asked to give a ‘dime at a time’“.❞
