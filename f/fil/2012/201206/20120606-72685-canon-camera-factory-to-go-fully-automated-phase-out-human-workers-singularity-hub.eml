Canon Camera Factory To Go Fully Automated, Phase Out Human Workers | Singularity Hub
http://singularityhub.com/2012/06/06/canon-camera-factory-to-go-fully-automated-phase-out-human-workers/

❝for the Japanese camera maker Canon, a fully automated factory is good business sense. Recently, the company announced that over the next few years, some of its camera factories will phase out human workers in an effort to reduce costs. That means robots will soon be making the next generation of cameras, possibly as soon as 2015. (...)
Even for Japan, globalization has led to exporting manufacturing jobs to countries where labor costs are lower, like China and India. So this announcement is a validation that robots are cheaper than humans for a manufacturing company, as long as the robotics technology is sophisticated enough to mimic human actions.❞
