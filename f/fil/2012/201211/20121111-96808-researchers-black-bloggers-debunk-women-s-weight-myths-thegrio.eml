❝“My readership consists of women who are tired of being told they’re not perfect because they’re not thin,” said Erica Nicole Kendall, the blogger behind Black Girl’s Guide to Weight Loss.

She said the women who read her site are “not attached to the idea that being healthy means they have to be rail thin.”

“But they’re not going to fool themselves on where they stand with their health right now,” she added.

The discussion around African-American women’s bodies and their sizes is a controversial one with many conflicting opinions. Some say black women are fat because they want to be.❞
