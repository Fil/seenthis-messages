❝NINE people in every 1 000 in Harare are at risk of developing colon or liver cancer from eating contaminated fish harvested from Lake Chivero and other water bodies around Harare, local scientific studies have indicated. 
A researcher with the University of #Zimbabwe ’s department of biological sciences, Maxwell Barson said the city faces a major cancer outbreak if its residents are not prevented from  eating heavily contaminated fish from water bodies surrounding the city.❞
