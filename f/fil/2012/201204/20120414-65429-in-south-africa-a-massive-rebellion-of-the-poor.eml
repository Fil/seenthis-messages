[In South Africa,] a massive rebellion of the poor
http://mg.co.za/article/2012-04-13-a-massive-rebellion-of-the-poor

❝During the past three years, 2009 to 2012, there has been an average of 2.9 unrest incidents a day. This is an increase of 40% over the average of 2.1 unrest incidents a day recorded for 2004-2009. 
The statistics show that what has been called the "rebellion of the poor" has intensified over the past three years.❞
