NISA on apology tour for mishandling U.S. radiation data - AJW by The Asahi Shimbun
http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201206290047

❝Government officials on June 28 apologized to municipalities around the crippled #Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant for failing to release U.S. data that could have prevented thousands from fleeing toward high-radiation areas.
(...) The Japanese government had up-to-date radiation measurements provided by the U.S. government, including a map that showed high levels of radiation moving northwest of the stricken nuclear plant.
But the information was not released, and residents, unaware of dangers they faced, fled in the direction of those high-radiation areas.
(...) The U.S. radiation information has now been lost or discarded at NISA’s emergency response center,❞
