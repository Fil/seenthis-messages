The #Yes_Men respond to #WikiLeaks’ #Stratfor email release | Green Left Weekly

❝“Maybe the Yes Men were the pinnacle. They made an argument in their way on their terms — that this is a corporate problem and a part of the a [sic] larger whole,” wrote Kathleen Morson, Stratfor’s Director of Policy Analysis.

“With less than a month to go [until the 25th anniversary], you'd think that the major players — especially #Amnesty — would have branched out from #Bhopal to make a broader set of issues. I don't see any evidence of it,” wrote Bart Mongoven, Stratfor’s Vice President, in November 2004. “If they can’t manage to use the 25th anniversary to broaden the issue, they probably won't be able to.”❞
