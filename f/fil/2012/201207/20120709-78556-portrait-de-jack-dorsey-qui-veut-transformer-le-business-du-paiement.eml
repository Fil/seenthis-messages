Portrait de Jack Dorsey, qui veut transformer le business du paiement
http://www.wired.com/business/2012/06/ff_dorsey/all/

❝Dorsey explained that he was going to empower everyone to accept cashless payments.

He took a piece of white plastic shaped roughly like an acorn, jammed it into the earphone jack of his iPhone, and asked me for my credit card. When I produced it, he swiped it through a slot on the acorn. Then he had me sign the screen with my finger and enter my email. When I checked my own iPhone, I had a message noting that I’d paid Jack Dorsey $1. A Google Maps image marked the location of the transaction. Dorsey was beaming like a proud parent.❞
