David Koch intends to cure #cancer in his lifetime and remake American politics
http://www.palmbeachpost.com/money/david-koch-intends-to-cure-cancer-in-his-2185046.html

❝With his brother Charles, he shares the No. 4 spot on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans. He holds board seats with 23 nonprofit groups and has pledged gifts totaling more than $750 million for cancer research, the arts and cultural institutions, according to his foundation.

But what has drawn controversy is that the brothers give many millions to far-right organizations dedicated to spreading an Ayn Rand-­infused ideology, one in which a benevolent business class flourishes, unfettered by taxes and regulations. Some have called it free-­market fundamentalism.
(...)
"That's what his legacy will hopefully be: finding a cure for cancer," Nicholas says. "That is his goal in life right now and it far exceeds any political views he has. Which are strong."❞
