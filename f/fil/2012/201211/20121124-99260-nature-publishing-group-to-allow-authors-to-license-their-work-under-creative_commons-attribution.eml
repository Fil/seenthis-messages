Nature Publishing Group to Allow Authors to License Their Work Under #Creative_Commons Attribution Licenses
http://infojustice.org/archives/27784

❝Earlier this month the Nature Publishing Group announced a new policy allowing authors of articles published in all 19 of its journals to publish under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Authors choosing to make their work available under a CC-BY license will pay a “premium” article processing charge, which Nature says will make up for income it typically earns on reprints.❞
