#Silk_Road (marketplace) - Wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)

❝Silk Road is an online marketplace whose operators run it as a Tor hidden service. Visitors must use #Tor to access the marketplace. The majority of products that sellers list on Silk Road qualify as contraband in most jurisdictions.[2] NPR has referred to the site as the "Amazon.com of illegal drugs".[3]❞

❝Silk Road places relatively few restrictions on the types of goods sellers can offer. From the Silk Road sellers’ guide [5],

“Do not list anything who’s (sic) purpose is to harm or defraud, such as stolen items or info, stolen credit cards, counterfeit currency, personal info, assassinations, and weapons of any kind. Do not list anything related to pedophilia.”

Conspicuously absent from the list of prohibited items are prescription drugs and narcotics, as well as pornography and fake identiﬁcation documents (e.g., counterfeit driver’s licenses). Weapons and ammunition used to be allowed until March 4, 2012, but have since then been re-listed on a sister site called The Armory [1], which operates with an infrastructure similar to that of Silk Road.❞

❝total sales volume of USD 1.9 million per month❞
