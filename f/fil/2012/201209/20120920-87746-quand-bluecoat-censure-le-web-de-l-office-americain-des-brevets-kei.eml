❝What I have found is more troubling than the initial case described yesterday.
The company providing the filtering services to the USPTO is Blue Coat (http://bluecoat.com). Blue Coat offers businesses, schools, federal agencies, foreign governments and others many different possible filters, and these are used in a variety of agency settings, including to filter content available to federal employees. This is how Blue Coat describes the "Political/Activist" filter:
Political/Activist Groups
Sites sponsored by or that provide information on political parties, special interest groups, or any organization that promotes change or reform in public policy, public opinion, social practice, or economic activities.
This is just one of dozens of filters that Blue Coat manages.❞
