http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/9728797/Worlds-oldest-and-biggest-trees-dying-out.html

❝Scientists have warned of an alarming increase in the death rates of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant, old trees that harbour and sustain countless birds and wildlife.

The trees at risk included mountain ash in Australia, pine trees in America, California redwoods, and baobabs in Tanzania

"Just as large-bodied animals such as elephants, tigers, and cetaceans have declined drastically in many parts of the world, a growing body of evidence suggests that large old trees could be equally imperilled."❞
