❝With a single CSS stylesheet, publishers can take XHTML source content and turn it into a laid-out, print-ready PDF. (...) by using XSL-FO and a PDF processor like #Antenna_House or #PrinceXML to read the markup, publishers can use a single XML source to flow neatly into #XHTML and #ePub and also to produce fully laid-out, print-quality PDFs.❞
