#Marikana: Lonmin strike ending, tensions remain | beyondbrics

❝Tuesday evening’s resolution of the strike at Lonmin, the South African platinum miner, is a welcome end to five weeks of industrial action marked by mass protests violently suppressed and 45 deaths. (...)

But there is a danger that the manner of its resolution could cause further unrest in the future.

(...) Lonmin’s strike was resolved not by the miners’ unions but by informal representatives of the strikers including miners, community leaders and the South African Council of Churches. Workers at other mines, some of whom have also staged disruptive actions during the Lonmin crisis, may see the Lonmin outcome as a precedent. If they conclude that illegal strikes are effective, that can’t be good for the industry’s stability.
(...)
Mining is central to the South African economy. Jacob Zuma, South Africa’s president, has raised the spectre of the sector’s problems tipping the economy into recession. That makes a peaceful and lasting solution to the industry’s problems – not least the ongoing strike at Gold Fields – all the more urgent.❞

❝Striking mineworkers in South Africa’s rich platinum belt and Lonmin, the London-listed company, reached a wage agreement on Tuesday that should signal the end of more than five weeks of industrial action marred by violence and 45 deaths.
The agreement covers several levels of mineworkers, including the 3,000 rock drill operators that started the strike, with an average rise in salaries of between  11 per cent and  22 per cent, as well as a one-off R2,000 ($244) bonus, Lonmin said in a statement.❞
