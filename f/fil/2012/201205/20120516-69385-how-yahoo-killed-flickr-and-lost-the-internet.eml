How #Yahoo Killed Flickr and Lost the Internet
http://gizmodo.com/5910223/how-yahoo-killed-flickr-and-lost-the-internet

❝As a result of being resource-starved, #Flickr quit planting the anchors it needed to climb ever higher. It missed the boat on local, on real time, on mobile, and even ultimately on social—the field it pioneered. And so, it never became the Flickr of video; #YouTube snagged that ring. It never became the Flickr of people, which was of course #Facebook. It remained the Flickr of photos. At least, until #Instagram came along.

The Flickr team was forced to focus on integration, not innovation.❞
