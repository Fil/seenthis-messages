South Korea’s surprising stand-down on digital textbooks - The Washington Post
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/south-koreas-surprising-stand-down-on-digital-textbooks/2012/03/25/gIQA6djvbS_blog.html

❝five years after advancing a plan to use technology to turn its education system into a 21st-century model, South Korea is rethinking one of the key elements of that push: digital textbooks.
Initially the plan called for digital books to be used in classrooms on every grade level by 2015. (...)

But now something has changed.

South Korean officials have suddenly become concerned that young people are too dependant on technological gadgets, pointing to a government survey that showed that one in 12 students between ages 5 and 9 are addicted to the Internet.❞
