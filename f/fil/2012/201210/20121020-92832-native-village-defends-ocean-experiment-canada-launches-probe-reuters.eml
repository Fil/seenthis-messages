❝(Reuters) - Leaders of a tiny, native village off Canada's remote northwest coast on Friday defended their decision to dump 120 tons of iron dust into the ocean as a legal experiment to revive salmon stocks, but Canada said it was investigating a possible breach of environmental law.

The village council conducted its C$2.5 million ($2.52 million) experiment in August in the waters around Haida Gwaii, an archipelago some 130 kilometers (81 miles) off the British Columbian coast.

In a project that has drawn widespread condemnation from scientists concerned about the impacts of unsupervised studies, the village employed scientists, biologists and technicians to pour iron sulphate into the water.❞
