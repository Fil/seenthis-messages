Why publishers should give away #ebooks
http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2012/01/why_publishers.php

❝record companies to start giving away a free digital copy of an album when you buy the vinyl version. Hidden inside the sleeve of a new record, like a Cracker Jack prize, is a little card with a code on it that let's you download the digital files of the songs, often in a lossless format, from the record company. So I no longer have to choose between the superior sound and packaging of vinyl and the superior mobility of digital.  (...) Buy the atoms, get the bits #free. That just feels right - in tune with the universe, somehow.❞
