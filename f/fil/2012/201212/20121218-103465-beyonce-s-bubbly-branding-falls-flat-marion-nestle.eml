Beyoncé’s Bubbly Branding Falls Flat - Marion Nestle
http://www.foodpolitics.com/2012/12/lets-ask-marion-beyonces-bubbly-branding-falls-flat/

❝Beyoncé will now be marketing sugar-sweetened beverages, products increasingly linked to childhood obesity, especially among minority children.

This linkage is not a coincidence. Pepsi and other makers of sugary sodas deliberately and systematically market their products to low-income, minority children.

If Beyoncé’s mission is to inspire young people of any color to look gorgeous and rise to the top, as she has done, she is now telling them that the way to get there—and to get rich—is to drink Pepsi. This untrue suggestion is, on its own, unethical.❞
