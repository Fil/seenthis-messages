Liquid gold: Farmers in #Nepal find resourceful way to fertilize crops
http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/news/2012/urine-as-fertilizer

❝Urine contains mostly water, mixed in with nutrients that plants can quickly and easily absorb. It is often compared to the nitrogen-rich fertilizer urea, except in liquid form and cost-free.

Separating urine at the source saves resources that would otherwise be disposed of as waste through expensive sewage treatment systems. Farmers can slightly offset their carbon footprint, and reduce the need for phosphorous found in depleted reserves. In countries like Nepal, where the supply of mineral fertilizer is limited, urine offers an accessible alternative.❞

Tamang is pleased with the size of the cabbages grown in his urine-fertilized field.❞
