The Internet Is a Major Driver of the Growth of Cognitive Inequality | Mother Jones
http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/02/internet-major-driver-growth-cognitive-inequality

❝Moral of the story: the internet makes dumb people dumber and smart people smarter. If you don't know how to use it, or don't have the background to ask the right questions, you'll end up with a head full of nonsense. But if you do know how to use it, it's an endless wealth of information. Just as globalization and de-unionization have been major drivers of the growth of income inequality over the past few decades, the internet is now a major driver of the growth of cognitive inequality. Caveat emptor.❞
