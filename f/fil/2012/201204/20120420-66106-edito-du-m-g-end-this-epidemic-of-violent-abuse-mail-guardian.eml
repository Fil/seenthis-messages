édito du M&G:

End this epidemic of violent abuse - Mail & Guardian
http://mg.co.za/article/2012-04-20-end-this-epidemic-of-violent-abuse

❝It is a crisis of multiple dimensions, but there can be little doubt that, in places where work and hope are scarce, where schools are dysfunctional and where state, community and family structures to contain and control violence are absent or overstretched and where alcohol regulations are unenforced, we are creating conditions for an epidemic of brutality.
(...)
We need a response on at least two levels. The first is a willingness by national leaders to campaign against both rape and the contempt of women that underpins the act in word and deed. The second is a recognition that *we are building settlements that reproduce sexual violence, crime and xenophobia*: shoddily constructed, disconnected from economic opportunity, home to failing schools that sit cheek by jowl with shebeens on shit-soaked streets.❞
