Keystone Protesters Pay Price for Camping in Texas Trees - Bloomberg
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-19/keystone-protesters-pay-price-for-camping-in-texas-trees.html

❝Protesters trying to save the world by sitting in trees or blocking equipment used to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline are learning that environmental activism can be a ticket to lengthy jail time in east Texas.

Matthew Almonte, Glen Collins and Isabel Brooks landed in jail in Tyler Dec. 3, charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass, resisting arrest and illegal dumping, following efforts to stop work on the TransCanada Corp. (TRP) pipeline. Each has asked for a reduction in the $65,000 bond that must be posted to get out pending trial, without success.

The trio joined more than 30 others arrested since October❞
