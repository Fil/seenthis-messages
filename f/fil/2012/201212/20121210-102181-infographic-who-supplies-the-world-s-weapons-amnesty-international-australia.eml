Infographic: Who supplies the world’s weapons? - Amnesty International Australia
http://www.amnesty.org.au/armstrade/comments/28384/

❝Did you know just six countries supply a whopping 74 percent of the world’s weapons?

Last year, when protesters throughout the Arab world demanded change, military forces in #Egypt, #Syria, #Bahrain and beyond responded with deadly force, staining the streets with the blood of more than 8,000 people.

This could happen because countries including #US, #Russia, #UK and #France have been exporting bombs, bullets and other weapons into the region for years -- putting their own multi-billion-dollar profits above the value of human lives.❞
