❝Swiss police are demanding compulsory DNA tests for asylum seekers after saying a rise in the numbers applying to stay in the country had a direct link with an increase in crime.

Police believe that the DNA database will allow a faster clear up rate of crimes by matching evidence found at the crime scene.❞
