Are organics more nutritious? Again? Sigh. | Food Politics

❝Isn’t reducing exposure to pesticides and antibiotic use precisely what organic production is supposed to do?

(...) This meta-analysis confirms that organic foods have much lower levels of these things.  I’d call that doing exactly what it is supposed to.

(...) The only reason for organics to be about nutrition is marketing.  Nutrition turns out to be a better selling point than lower levels of pesticides and antibiotics.  It also makes better headlines, apparently.

But aren’t those lower levels—in production and in the body—good reasons to buy organics?❞
