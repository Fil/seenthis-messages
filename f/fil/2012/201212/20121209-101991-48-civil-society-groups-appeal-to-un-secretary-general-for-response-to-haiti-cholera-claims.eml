❝Re: Request for UN response to claims for reparations for victims of cholera in Haiti
Your Excellency:
We are writing to urge the United Nations (UN) to demonstrate its leadership in human rights by responding to claims by victims of Haiti’s ongoing cholera epidemic. Despite extensive evidence that UN troops brought cholera to Haiti, the UN has not responded to the claims of victims seeking reparations beyond acknowledging receipt, nor articulated a process for reviewing these claims.  (...) The epidemic has killed over 7,600 Haitians and sickened more than 600,000 since cholera broke out in October 2010.❞
